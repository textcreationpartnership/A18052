            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

My ſecond ſuite is, that you would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to iudge of the whole Worke by ſome parts and paſſages of it, eſpecially in the beginning of it (which perhaps will hardly ſatisfie the iudicious Reader) but to ſhew me this fauour, if you make a beginning, to take the paines at your leiſure, to reade all: I dare promiſe nothing, yet my hope is, that, ſo doing, your labour (as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the good hearer is deſcribed by his propertie, which is wiſdome; hee <hi>likeneth him to a wiſeman.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie euery one is moſt liquoriſh of, taking after their great grand-mother <hi>Eue;</hi> who though ſhe were made wiſe enough, if ſhe could haue ſeene it, yet would needs ſing a note aboue <hi>Ela,</hi> and bee made wiſer by the counſell of the old Cheater, the Deuill, ſpeaking in the Serpent: whereby it came to paſſe, that inſtead of attayning to an higher pitch of knowledge, to bee like vnto God, as hee bare her in hand, ſhee loſt that which ſhe had, and plunged herſelfe, withall her miſerable poſteritie, into extreme folly and vanitie, ending in vtter perdition.

            <p>But we are further to vnderſtand, that by comparing this Text with <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 47. where our Sauiour Chriſt ſhutteth vp his Sermon with this very concluſion, we ſhall find, wherein the life and excellencie of his wiſdome conſiſteth; not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting vpon the righteouſneſſe of the Law, or of workes; much leſſe vpon the traditions of men, or vpon morall and ciuill virtues: but in <hi>digging deepe, and laying the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on a rocke;</hi> which is, when we labour with all our might to come to the true knowledge of our ſelues, how ſinfull and damnable we are by nature, through the right vnderſtanding of the Law of God: to come alſo to the ſound and ſauing knowledge of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> crucified for our ſinnes, through the right vnde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the third place, the good hearer is deſcribed by his outward condition: he is lyable to moſt grieuous afflictions and perſecutions, which by diuine ordination, vſually follow the hearer and doer of theſe ſayings, for his <note n="c" place="margin">Hebr. 12. 5, 6.</note> correction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and purgation from the moſt dangerous humour of pride and haughtineſſe eſpecially.

            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, the good hearer is deſcribed by the fruit, euent, or ſucceſſe, which is his ſtabilitie and perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the greateſt ſtormes, when the Deuill and World haue done their worſt; <hi>It fell not</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>for it was founded vpon the rocke.</hi> The good hearer is (as wee heard) founded vpon <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> and the promiſes of God (which all <note n="h" place="margin">2.

               <hi>in him are yea, and in him Amen</hi>) apprehended by Faith, and confeſſed with the mouth, ſo that the gates of Hell cannot preuaile againſt him, as we ſee, <hi>Matth. 16. 16, 17, 18.

               <hi>As the whirlewind paſſeth, ſo is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an euerlaſting foundation.</hi> Queſtionleſſe, nothing is more ſickle and vaniſhing, then the irreligious rout, ſeeme they neuer ſo well rooted and flouriſhing; <hi>I haue</hi> (ſaith <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 37, 35. 37. 39.</note> the Pſalmiſt) <hi>ſeene the wicked in great power, and ſpreading himſelfe like a greene Bay-tree, yet he paſſed away and loe he was not. But marke the perfect man, and behold the vpright, for</hi> (howſoeuer he ſeeme to bee expoſed to all dangers and miſeries) <hi>the end of that man is peace,</hi> or happineſſe: And no maruell, ſince their ſaluation is of the Lord; he is their ſtrength in the time of trouble; They <note n="l" place="margin">Prou. 14. 32.</note> 
               <hi>haue alſo hope,</hi> and a ſure refuge, <hi>euen in their death.</hi> To conclude this point concerning the good hearer; As a houſe, well built vpon a rocke, may bee, and is commonly ſhaken, but falleth not: ſo the hearer and doer of theſe ſayings, well built vpon the rocke <hi>CHRIST IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> through <note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>faith, that worketh by loue,</hi> may bee, and is diuers times fearefully ſhaken, by reaſon of hard perſecution and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but fall he cannot fully and finally.</p>
            <p>The euill hearer is deſcribed, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> 26. 27. by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries to all the former: Firſt, he ioyneth not practiſe to his

               <hi>that beholdeth his naturall face in a glaſſe, and going away ſtraight-way forgetteth what manner of man he was.</hi> As if it were all Religion, and not rather the greateſt irreligion, to heare and not to doe.

            <p>Secondly, the euill hearer is deſcribed by his propertie: for he ranketh all ſuch among ſtarke Fooles, who heare, and doe not what they heare; how ſharpe-ſighted, and politicke ſoeuer they be in worldly things. For whereunto may they be better compared then to patients, dangerouſly and (with out the Phyſicians helpe) deſperately ſicke, that make none other vſe of their learned, and well experienced Phyſicians counſell, but onely to heare it, letting the practiſe goe, at their vttermoſt perill?

Not without cauſe doth the Prophet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> breake forth into this vehement exclamation. <note n="o" place="margin">Ier. 8 8. 9.</note> 
               <hi>How ſay yee, that we are wiſe, and the Law of the Lord is with vs?

            <p>Thirdly, the euill hearer is deſcribed by that, which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly befalleth him, what turnings of deuices ſoeuer he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, howſoeuer hee would bee content<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to fell away <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> his Lord, that bought him, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his Kingdome (as <hi>Eſau</hi> did his birth-right) to purchaſe his worldly peace, and further his owne ends: yet is hee to expect, that God at one time, or other, will, by ſtrong and ſtrange trials, bring him alſo to the Touch-ſtone, and make it appeare, That all is not gold that ſhineth. Hee will winnow and weigh him to make his lightneſſe manifeſt to all the World. Thus much hee would haue vs to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

            <p>Fourthly, the contrarie euent of hearing, and not doing, is propounded and aggrauated, <hi>The Houſe fell, and the fall was great.</hi> Deſtruction ſhall bee to all workers of iniquitie, yea (as wee heard before) <hi>euery tree that beareth not good fruit, ſhall bee hewen downe, and caſt into the ſire;</hi> though they neuer heard any one ſyllable of the Word of God: but it ſhall come with a witneſſe, in a moſt high and fearefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, vpon all reiecters, or neglecters of holy doctrine, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the moſt glorious Goſpell of <hi>IES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST, How</hi>

               <hi>ſhall they eſcape</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>if they neglect ſo great ſaluation? which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to vs, by them that heard him; God alſo bearing witnes with ſignes, &amp; wonders, and diuers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Ouer ſuch neglecters are the woes pronounced, and iudgements de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <note n="q" place="margin">Matth. 11. 21, 23.</note> 
               <hi>Woe be to thee Chorazin; Woe be to thee, Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida, &amp;c. And thou Capernaum, which art exalted vnto Heauen, ſhalt be brought downe vnto Hell: It ſhalbee more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon, and the Land of Sodome, at the laſt day, then for you.</hi> So <hi>Wiſdome</hi> (euen the eſſentiall wiſdome of God, <hi>CHRIST IESVS</hi>) is moſt earneſt, ample, and admirable in this ſubiect, <note n="r" place="margin">Prou. 1. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe I haue called, and yee refuſed; I haue ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded: but haue ſet at nought all my counſell, and would none of my reproofe; I will alſo laugh at your calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and mocke when your feare commeth: when your feare commeth as deſolation, and your deſtruction, as a whirlewind, when diſtreſſe and anguiſh come vpon you; then ſhall they call vpon me, but I will not anſwere; they ſhall ſeeke mee early, but they ſhall not find mee: for that they hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the feare of the Lord: they would none of my counſell, they deſpiſed all my reproofe. Therefore ſhall they eate of the fruit of their owne way, and bee filled with their owne deuices.</hi> So fearefull is the eſtate of him, <hi>that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and doth not,</hi> euen by the teſtimony of the diuine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16709:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> and truth it ſelfe, deliuered with ſuch vehemencie, as if he would ſhake Heauen and Earth.</p>
            <p>Thus much of theſe foure Verſes, contayning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of Chriſts Sermon: wherein becauſe hee layeth all vpon the doing, or not doing of theſe his <hi>ſayings,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending a ſhort ſummary of his heauenly doctrine, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of that part, which concerneth a right Chriſtian conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, it will be worth the while to take a view of them, as they lie in order, and to compare our liues to them. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of moſt it may too truly be ſpoken, as <hi>Linacre,</hi> that famous Phyſician, is reported to haue ſaid to King <hi>Henrie</hi> the Eight; <hi>Either theſe ſayings are not CHRISTS, or we are not Chriſtians.</hi> And wee are the rather to lay our liues to theſe rules, becauſe (as wee may perceiue by that which hath beene alreadie ſaid) in the keeping heereof conſiſteth our wiſdome, and ſafetie, amidſt the greateſt differences, dangers, and vexations, that can befall in this life; and in the neglecting, moſt certaine, ineuitable, and intolerable ruine, though all both men and Angels ſhould lay their heads and hands together to hold vs vp; <note n="ſ" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>To make the better way heereunto, let vs firſt take in the ſumme of our Lord <hi>CHRISTS</hi> foregoing doctrine: which we may doe the more eaſily becauſe it is ſummed vp by this our Euangeliſt, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. 17. in one onely word, <hi>RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PENT;</hi> that none ſhould pleade the ſlipperineſſe of his memorie, for who cannot (if he ſet his mind vpon it) remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that one word? And further to admoniſh vs, that there is none obedience at all yeelded to <hi>CHRISTS</hi> ſayings, by them, that repent not of their ſinnes: and when men doe once vnfainedly repent, all obedience will follow. Yet muſt we not imagine, that our Lord <hi>CHRIST</hi> went vp and downe, repeating this bare word alone, but rather inſiſting vpon the doctrine and neceſſitie of repentance, did explane, dilate, and vrge it euery where, vpon euery occaſion.

               <hi>Thoſe mine enemies, which would not, that I ſhould reigne ouer them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> Let this ſuffice for Chriſt's foregoing doctrine.</p>
            <p>That which remayneth now, is to take a view of his whole <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 5. 1, 2.</note> Sermon; the occaſion whereof was offered by the maruellous concourſe of people, aſſembling vnto him from all parts, as is ſhewed, <hi>Chap</hi> 4. 25. as alſo by the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his owne Diſciples, flocking about him to heare his

               <hi>Mary,</hi> in the Goſpell, wee ſit not aſſiduouſly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueably at the feete of this great Prophet, and open not our cares with due reuerence and deuotion, to heare his Word.

            <p>It may be reduced to theſe three heads; firſt, he inſtructeth vs more fully, who are capable of that Kingdome, either of grace or glory, and ſo to be accounted truly bleſſed: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by what meanes, this great dignitie is to bee attayned vnto: thirdly, what their conuerſation is, and ought to bee, who are of that ranke.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſubiect of bleſſednes, it hath beene much canuaſſed by the great Philoſophers, and wiſemen of the world, placing it, ſome in one thing, ſome in another: but in fine, after all diſputes, leauing the matter as vncertaine as they found it. But this our heauenly teacher, without any going about the buſh, or intricate diſcourſe, in very few words ſetteth downe moſt plainely and pithily, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb facs="tcp:16709:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> bleſſed; euen ſuch as naturall men iudge of all other, to be moſt wretched and miſerable; whom he deſcribeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their bleſſedneſſe. <hi>Cap. 5. verſ.</hi> 3. to 13. Firſt by their preparation to the kingdome of heauen, and ſo to true bleſſedneſſe. They are <hi>poore in ſpirit, they mourne, they hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe.</hi> Secondly, by their inward diſpoſition, they are <hi>meeke, mercifull, pure in heart, peace-makers.</hi> Thirdly, by their outward condition; they are ſo farre from ciuill and worldly happineſſe, that they are forced to vndergoe many &amp; manifold croſſes, eue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> for their righteouſneſſe ſake.</p>
            <p>To take theſe things in order, as they are layed before vs; in the <note n="p" place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> text, firſt hee pronounceth them bleſſed (what frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or calamities ſoeuer they labour vnder) who are poore, not ſo much in purſe, as in <hi>ſpirit,</hi> being of a broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, trembling at the word of God, whoſe diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they feare (not with ſeruile, but reuerentiall feare) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all dreadfull things, and whoſe mercy, through <hi>CHRIST IESVS,</hi> they make their onely refuge, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming all affiance in themſelues or any creature. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſcious of their owne wants and weakneſſes, they are much more vile in their owne eyes, then they are, or can be in other folkes, as wee ſee plainely <note n="q" place="margin">Luke 18. 13.</note> in the poore Publican.

            <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. hee pronounceth them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, not who are at eaſe in <hi>Zion,</hi> and liue deliciouſly, but that <hi>mourne,</hi> not a thouſandth part ſo much for their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and miſeries (though they bee ſenſible of them, and bewaile them alſo, as very bitter fruits of that bitter root of ſinne) but as S. <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth, <note n="r" place="margin">Iames 4. 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>they are afflicted, ſorrow, and weepe, they turne their carnall laughter into mourning,</hi> and ioy into heauineſſe, caſting downe themſelues for their ſinnes before the Lord: In which reſpect, they grieue at the heart, that they can grieue no more. This <hi>godly ſorrow for

In godly ſorrow, the mourning is for ſinne, as it is ſin and offence againſt the diuine Maieſtie, and not for by-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as feare of puniſhment, ſhame of the world, loſſes and croſſes. Againe, it is ioyned with hope of pardon, and full purpoſe of an intire reformation. It is alſo exerciſed not onely about our owne ſinnes and euils, but (with <note n="ſ" place="margin">2.

Hee admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth alſo all Chriſtian people of all ages, what they are to expect at the hands of their ſpirituall Parents, Paſtours and Teachers. By foure excellent ſimilitudes hee expreſſeth to the quicke, of what manner of carriage they ought to bee, both for doctrine and conuerſation: whereof the firſt two, drawne from Salt, and the Sunne, ſeeme to concerne their doctrine chiefly; the other two, drawne from a Citie vpon a Hill, and a Candle lighted in the houſe, their conuerſation eſpecially.</p>
            <p>All the Inhabitants of the earth, ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, are gone backe from God, and become vnſauoury, as wee may ſee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 3. and elſewhere. God, looking downe from Heauen, found all corrupt, filthy, or ſtinking, none excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Now as the nature of Salt is to ſucke out corruption, to make meates ſauoury, and to preſerue from putrifaction:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:16709:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo the office of the Apoſtles, and all Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, is, to fret out the corruption inherent in nature, by little and little, to reconcile to God, making their hearers acceptable by faith in Chriſt Ieſus; and finally by their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable forewarnings to ſaue from deſtruction. An euident demonſtration whereof we haue in the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> who, among the reſt, heere is called <hi>the ſalt of the earth,</hi> that is, of the Inhabitants of the earth.

               </gap>ptized, whereby he reconcileth them to God, and maketh them acceptable through Ieſus Chriſt: and laſtly, he taketh a courſe to preſerue them in the ſtate of grace, when with many words he teſtified, and exhorted, ſaying <hi>Saue your ſelues from this vntoward Generation.</hi> Theſe Conuerts alſo (three thouſand in all) thus purged from their corruption, and ſeaſoned with the ſalt of that holy doctrine, know none other way to preſerue themſelues from relapſe, and to grow more ſauoury, (that is, acceptable to God, and approued of men) then to lay themſelues in this miniſteriall pickle, or pouldering-trough. Wherefore it is ſaid of them, that after Baptiſme, <hi>They continued in the Apoſtles doctrine, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, and breaking of bread, and Prayers;</hi> vſing the ſame Miniſterie for their preſeruation and increaſe in grace, which it pleaſed Almightie God to vſe at the firſt for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion. In all which, they are exemplary to vs, both for the dutie performed, and manner of performance, which was with all diligence, alacritie, and ſedulitie on all parts, both of the Apoſtles, and people alſo. This is the rather to bee layd to heart of all, becauſe as Salt, hauing once loſt his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, becommeth altogether vnprofitable, yea noxious, or
<pb facs="tcp:16709:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> hurtfull, euen to the very dunghill, and that vnrecouerably: ſo if the vertue and operation of this Euangelicall ſalt, either in the ſeaſoners, or ſeaſoned, doe periſh through negligence, or bee waſhed away by the loue of the world, voluptuous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or ſtorme of perſecution, they proue, of all people, moſt debauched and dangerous, and that vnrecouerably. Againe, all the world ſitteth in darknes, &amp; in the ſhadow of death their eſtate is altogether diſmall &amp; diſconſolate: now the calling of the Apoſtles was to bee the light and Sunne of the world (not or ginally, that was Chriſt Ieſus his peculiar honour; but miniſterially, by communication of his light to them) to cleere, and cheere the ſoules, as the light of the ſunne doth the outward man; To cleare, I ſay, their mindes, and to cheere their hearts, by giuing the light of <note n="e" place="margin">2.

This is alſo the honour of euery paſtor and teacher in his owne flock, which ſerueth to commend the calling of the miniſtery aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the excellencie and neceſſitie of it.</p>
            <p>By the third ſimilitude, drawne from a Citie on an hill, he admoniſheth his Apoſtles and all teachers, that being as they are, in the view of all, good, and bad, they ſhould, in all their wayes, walke ſo circumſpectly and trylie, as might be to the admiration, inſtruction, edification, or conuiction, at the leaſt, of the lookers on.

By which efficacie
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16709:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> he reneweth vs alſo, after the image of God, in knowledge, in righteouſneſſe, and true holineſſe.

Let this ſuffice for the ſecond paſſage, contayning the three meanes of ataining to bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to wit, the miniſterie of the Goſpell; the Law and the Prophets; and Chriſts fulfilling of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
            <p>The third part of this Sermon followeth, concerning the righteouſneſſe of all thoſe, who are to be accounted worthy to partake this bleſſedneſſe. This righteouſneſſe is firſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; ſecondly, commended, thirdly, explained. It is moſt ſhortly, but moſt pithily both deſcribed, and commended, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> 19. and then explained in the reſt of the Sermon. The whole nineteenth verſe is inferred vpon his former ſpeeches to this effect; Since I came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfill them: againe, ſince no one iote or ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Law ſhall paſſe vnfulfilled, <hi>Therefore, whoſoeuer ſhall break one of theſe leaſt commandements, &amp; teach men ſo, &amp;c.</hi> where to make the deſcription of righteouſneſſe more cleare and lightſome, hee illuſtrateth it, by prefixing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the contrary vnrighteouſneſſe. As if hee ſhould ſay, that you may know your owne dutie the better, learne to know an vngodly teacher and liuer by theſe properties; firſt, by not teaching what hee ought, or not doing what hee teacheth, for this is to breake the law of God. Secondly, by conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ting and maintayning ſome of the ſacred commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God to be of little or no moment, in compariſon of mens traditions, as did <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 15. 16.</note> the Scribes and Phariſees; or in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16709:21"/> of his luſts, as did <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 14. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Herod,</hi> who would needes take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to hold his <hi>Herodias.</hi> Thirdly, he would haue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as bad as himſelfe; other ſolkes muſt thinke, as his bels tinke, <hi>he teacheth men ſo.</hi> So that this in ſhort, is the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a wicked and vnhappie perſon; he breaketh the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, at the leaſt, ſome one or few, which he conceiteth himſelfe, and would beare other folkes in hand, not to be ſo greatly neceſſarie: and is an author to all others (ſo much as in him is) to doe the like, which is the brand of one that breaketh them habitually. For otherwiſe through ignorance and frailtie, who doth not?</p>
            <p>Hee deſcribeth the righteouſneſſe of all ſuch as are truely bleſſed, in theſe words, <hi>whoſoeuer ſhall doe and teach,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thoſe commandements before ſpoken of, euen to <hi>the leaſt.</hi> Wherein, firſt obſerue, that a bleſſed man (whoſe righteouſneſſe is here deſcribed) is not a talker and profeſſor onely, but a conſtant doer of Gods precepts, or of all holy and heauenly doctrine; to wit, Euangellically, or according to the tenor of the Goſpel, that is, vnder the promiſe of moſt gracious acceptance, through Chriſt Ieſus, as of his perſon, ſo of his ſincere indeuour to doe the whole will of God; as alſo of free pardon, vpon his repentance, when at any time hee treadeth his foot awry. For otherwiſe, <note n="c" place="margin">Pſal. 130. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldſt marke iniquitie, who ſhall ſtand? but there is forgiueneſſe with thee, that thou maiſt be feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, a bleſſed man performeth vniuerſall obedience to all, euen to the very leaſt of Gods commandements. Hee doth not onely caſhiere the traditions of men, and their groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſinnes, but laboreth, as in a caſe of life and death, to bring into captiuitie euery luſt, yea, euery thought, to the moſt holy law of God. He counts nothing little, that proceedeth out of the ſacred mouth of God, and which hath the tagge (as Maſter <hi>Bradford</hi> tearmeth it) of Gods heauie curſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all tranſgreſſors, annexed to it. Hee knoweth none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to heauen, then to be holy as he is holy, and to walk in light, as he is in light. And if he knew any other way, yet he would take none other then this, whereby alone God is

            <p>The third point, concerning righteouſneſſe is the expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:16709:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> which holdeth to the very concluſion of the whole Sermon. Hee explayneth the matter concerning righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, firſt, by the contrarie; ſecondly, by the properties; thirdly, by the parts. The contrary to it, is ſet downe, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> 20. and it is <hi>the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſies,</hi> which was legall onely, traditionall, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall; legall, becauſe they ſought not righteouſneſſe by Faith in Chriſt, who onely fulfilleth the Law for vs, but by <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 9. 32.</note> 
               <hi>the workes of the Law;</hi> traditionall, becauſe they both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the Law, &amp; alſo blended the worſhip of God, with their own traditions; hypocrtical, becauſe in all their glorious workes, they ſought the applauſe of men, rather then the glory of God. <hi>Except,</hi> in all theſe, <hi>our righteouſneſſe exceed theirs,</hi> our Lord Chriſt peremptorily auoucheth heere, that we <hi>ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdome of Heauen,</hi> wee ſhall haue nothing at all to doe with his Church either Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant, or triumphant.

               <hi>Who onely ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Law for vs,</hi> and we in him; except we performe to God <note n="e" place="margin">Num. 15. 39.</note>

            <p>The properties of righteouſneſſe (which is the ſecond branch) are three, in like manner: for it is ſpirituall, vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall, and ſincere. Hee proueth it to bee ſpirituall, by giuing the true interpretation of the ſixt, of the ſeuenth, and of the third Commandements: of which briefly, becauſe they are Catechiſticall points, which are, or ought to be often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. The ancient interpretation of the <note n="g" place="margin">Verſe 21.</note> ſixt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſee, how little heed is to be giuen to bare Antiquitie) by tradition, was, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> that is, lay violent hands vpon thy Neighbour, to take away his life vniuſtly, as <hi>Cain</hi> did <hi>Abels.</hi> This onely in the ſence of theſe goodly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, the Scribes and Phariſies, maketh one guiltie of bloud, and the Murtherer worthy of death temporall by mans iudgement, and of eternall by Gods iudgement.

               </gap>radition, teacheth, that as God, the Law-giuer, is a Spirit, Maker and Searcher of the very hearts and reines, ſo his Law is ſpirituall, requiring ſpiritull obedience in euery thing: forbidding on the otherſide, whatſoeuer is contrarie thereunto, ſeeme it neuer ſo light in the eyes of carnall men; as raſh anger, or any light contempt, expreſſed by <hi>Racha</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, (which word ſeemeth to import one voide or emptie of good iudgement) among vs, by <hi>Dunce, Dolt, Aſſe, Block-head, Gooſe, Woodcocke,</hi> and many ſuch like.

Much more hee forbiddeth vnder Murther, contumelious and reproachfull termes, as <hi>Foole, Knaue, Rogue, Raſcall, baſe Companion,</hi> and ſuch like. In ſumme, he forbiddeth whatſoeuer ſtandeth not with vnfeigned Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to our Neighbours perſon. The fearefull danger of all which, he expreſſeth by a ſimilitude, drawn from the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Courts, or proceedings in iudgement, who are ſaid to haue one, conſiſting of three Commiſſioners, appointed to iudge of leſſe offences; another, of three and twentie, appointed to iudge of greater offences; another of ſeuentie two, called the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or counſell of eſtate, to iudge of the greateſt offences. As then among the <hi>Iewes</hi> there were degrees of puniſhment, according to the qualitie and heinouſneſſe of the offences, yet was it intended, that none offender ſhould goe vnpuniſhed: ſo is it in Gods proceeding; all breakers of this, as of other his moſt holy Lawes, ſhall be puniſhed, but the greater offender ſhall haue the greater torture inflicted vpon him. Which conſideration (to let other things paſſe) ought to bee an effectuall motiue to draw our hearts to the obedience of all, euen of the leaſt of Gods Commandements, and the very leaſt branches of euery one of them. And to that end, to ſearch diligently the extent of euery precept, becauſe knowledge, of neceſſitie, muſt goe before practice, and <note n="i" place="margin">Prou. 19. 2.</note> 
               <hi>without knowledge, the minde is not good.</hi> This alſo calleth for a further degree of repentance, and watchfulneſſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16709:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> ouer our hearts and wayes, then is commonly thought vpon. Contrariwiſe, by Chriſts expoſition of this ſixt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, whatſoeuer things apperteine to Loue and Charitie are called for; as <note n="k" place="margin">Verſe 23, 24.</note> reconciliation with the offended bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which he maketh ſo neceſſary, that though a <hi>Iew</hi> came as farre as the very Altar, with his gift or ſacrifice, and there remembred an offence made to his Brother or Neighbour, not to preſume to offer his gift, but to leaue it there, vntill attonement were made with him. God, in iuſt offences, will haue their brother appeaſed, or at the leaſt, all meanes to be vſed for pacification, before he would bee appeaſed, or at all accept of their perſon or deuotion: which holdeth in like manner with vs Chriſtians; reconciliation one with another, or at the leaſt, our beſt endeauour for it, muſt, of neceſſitie, goe before, not onely the holy Communion, but all our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deuotions whatſoeuer, if wee make account to doe our ſelues any good thereby, and not rather to irritate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the wrath of God againſt our ſelues, for ſome degree of Murther. This holdeth alſo in them, that goe to Law, or are like to goe to Law one with another: whom Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour of this ſixt Commandement, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to ſpeedie agreement, if not of conſcience, (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without any by-reſpect, ought to be) yet in godly po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, for feare of after-claps; not onely through the rigour and crueltie of our aduerſary prouoked by vs: but euen through the iuſt iudgement of God, hardening his heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs. So that when we will not, at Gods bidding, <hi>agree with our aduerſary quickly, while wee are in the way with him,</hi> that is, before the matter come to tryall (though it bee with loſſe) wee may thanke our ſelues, if afterward, being caſt, he take the whole Law of vs, ſo farre forth, as to caſt vs into Priſon, and euen to make Dice of our bones (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mercileſſe Prouerbe) becauſe not onely Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and friends, but Chriſt himſelfe could beare no palme with vs, to giue in, in time.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, to prooue our righteouſneſſe to bee ſpirituall, hee handleth the ſeuenth Commandement, <hi>Thou
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16709:25"/> ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> reſtoring it to the naturall and full ſence. The Scribes and Phariſies were herein (according to their vſuall manner) too literall; confining (as appeareth <hi>Verſe</hi> 27.) all adulterie to the groſſe act of vncleanneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene parties, whereof one, at the leaſt, was married. But our Lord Chriſt (gaging the veſſell to the bottome) teacheth, that the <note n="l" place="margin">Verſe 28.</note> 
               <hi>luſt of the heart</hi> is adulterie before God, who is the former and beholder of the heart, and gaue his Lawes for the bridling of it, as well as of the members: yea, much more of it, as being the maſter-wheele, that turneth all the reſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the vnchaſt looke, whereby luſt is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and increaſed, doth participate with that ſinne, and is a breach of the ſeuenth Commandement: which cauſed <hi>Iob to</hi> 
               <note n="m" place="margin">Iob. 31. 1.</note> 
               <hi>make a couenant with his eyes, not to behold a Maide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, all occaſions of ſtumbling and falling into adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie come within this ranke; whether the neerer and deerer, like vnto <note n="n" place="margin">Verſe 29, 30.</note> ones <hi>right hand, or right eye,</hi> or more remote, <note n="o" place="margin">Verſe 31, 32.</note> as diuorces, or any thing of the like nature. How neere and deere ſoeuer any occaſion of whoredome (ſo of any other ſinne) be, though it bee eſteemed as the <hi>right eye,</hi> or <hi>hand,</hi> yet except we would be caſt into Hell fire vnrecouerably, it muſt not onely, through Gods mercifull aſſiſtance bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, but cut off, and caſt away with the vttermoſt dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation, that can be, what temporall paine ſoeuer it put vs to, or what miſſe ſoeuer we may ſeeme to haue of it. The neere and deere occaſions of incontinencie, by any meanes, to bee cut off and caſt away, are theſe, and ſuch like, An idle and eaſie life, pampering and decking of the corps, laſciuious company and communication, needleſſe gadding, with neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of our callings, impure thoughts entertayned with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, haunting of ſuſpected houſes, vnſeaſonable meetings, and reuellings, Loue-ſongs and Bookes, ribald-talke, if not vſed, yet heard and indured of vs, filthy obiects in Pictures, Playes, or whatſoeuer elſe ſtirreth vp corrupt nature, prone to ſuch vncleanneſſe, eſpecially in youth and out of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. The remote occaſion, which participateth with adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16709:25" rendition="simple:additions"/> and ſo commeth to bee forbidden in the ſeuenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, is cauſeleſſe diuorce: (Now Chriſt aloweth of none to be iuſt and warrantable, except in the caſe of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, whereby the marriage-band is broken:) The Scribes and Phariſies taught, that <hi>Moſes</hi> made it lawfull for men to to put away their wiues, foreuery cauſe, and that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to giue her a Bil of Diuorce, which made her free to marrie any other: but Chriſt, heere and elſe-where, teacheth farre otherwiſe; that for the hardneſſe of their hearts, this was onely tole<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ated, not alowed: and that by ſuch putting a way, the haſtie and furious Husband occaſioned both his Wife, and him, that ſhould marrie with her, to commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, beſides the temptations, which he ſhould put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon. So that by ſuch Diuorces, a great many tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of this Law, both his owne, and of other folkes, were ſet vpon his skore. Teaching vs this great leſſon by the way, that he who is the occaſion of ſinning to others, is guiltie of all ſinnes committed, or which might haue beene committed vpon that occaſion. Which made <hi>Dauid,</hi> though hee did not commit Idolatry, yet to curſe his Aduerſaries, that gaue the occaſion, <note n="o" place="margin">1. Sam. 26. 19</note> 
               <hi>Curſed bee they,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>before the Lord, for they haue driuen me out this day, from abiding in the inheritance of the Lord, ſaying, Goe, ſerue other gods.</hi> This ought to be of vſe to Chriſtians, who, though they haue no ſuch cauſeleſſe Diuorces tolerated, yet many times goe ſo farre, as to ſeparation of the Wife from the Husband, or the Husband from his Wife: or if not ſo farre, yet to many brawles and much bitterneſſe, ſo that though one houſe hold them, yet one bed will not. If this, by Chriſts expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, come not within the compaſſe of the breach of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Commandement, and adde not many ſinnes to the ſcore of the nocent or offending partie, what doth?</p>
            <p>In the third place, to ſhew that our righteouſneſſe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, muſt bee ſpirituall, <note n="p" place="margin">Ver. 33. to 38</note> hee handleth in like manner, the third Commandement, concerning the not taking of the moſt ſacred Name of God in vaine; reſtoring it to the full ſence, which of long time had beene maymed by the Scribes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:16709:26"/> and Phariſees, who reſtrained it to for ſwearing onely. So farre had they learned to goe by the letter of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, <note n="q" place="margin">Leu. 19. 12.</note> 
               <hi>ye ſhall not ſweare by my name falſly, nor prophane the name of my God.</hi> They made therefore great conſcience of periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and forſwearing, which they knew to be a fearefull defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the reuerend name of God, which hee would by no meanes put vp. But our Lord Chriſt, knowing right well, what awfull reſpect ought to be giuen to that glorious name no wayes to be taken vp in vaine, nor made to trot (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is) for euery trifling and friuolous matter; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo what truth and ſimplicitie ought to be among men, forbiddeth in ordinarie communication, to ſweare at all by the name of God, not onely directly, by vſing, or rather abuſing any of his titles, but indirectly, by any creature, as <hi>heauen, earth, Ieruſalem, his head,</hi> and ſuch like, in which, as in all other creatures, the glory of God ſhineth, and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name is engrauen as it were: ſo that he which ſweareth by any creature, ſweareth by the Creator, as wee ſee plainely, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 20, 21, 22. Which expoſition of Chriſt condemneth them of moſt hainous offence, with whom it is ordinarie to ſweare by their <hi>faith, troth, honeſtie, by bread, light,</hi> and ſuch like, (for vaine people haue their fantaſticke faſhions for oathes, as they haue for their apparell:) much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth it ſuch as vſe oathes of louder blaſphemie, <hi>by God, by Ieſus, Gods wounds, bloud, heart, death, (horreſco refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens)</hi> an honeſt heart, cannot ſpeake or heare ſuch things without horror.

Though they bring fire, wee will bring water; though their furie and rage againſt vs breake out violently, as a bullet out of the mouth of a Canon, we will ſet our patience as a wooll-packe, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a mount againſt it. Hee <note n="e" place="margin">Ver. 39, 40, 41</note> explaineth this point by three notable inſtances, or occaſions, wherein he will haue our righteouſneſſe ſhine forth: the firſt is of the groſſeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelie that can bee offered to our perſons; when in hatred or contempt, wee are ſmitten on the face with the hand, or with a rod: wherein he will haue vs value our charitie, and patience, at ſo high a rate, that the greateſt indignitie vnder the heauen ſhall not put vs out of it. As it did not himſelfe,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16709:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> howſoeuer (according to <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtatas prophane ſcoffe) he did not literally turne the other cheeke, when the officer ſmote him on the face, but gaue a milde and cold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. 18. 23.</note> 
               <hi>If I haue ſpoken euill, beare witneſſe of the euill: but of well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi> iuſt according to the tenour and purport of this precept, hee choſe rather to receiue double wrong, then to reuenge his owne griefe, though hee had twelue legious of Angels at command, <note n="g" place="margin">Reu. 13. 10.</note> 
               <hi>Here is the patience and the faith of the Saints,</hi> ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond inſtance is of the hardeſt exigent that can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall vs in our outward eſtate, (which we know, is moſt deare to moſt people) when we are ſued at the law, euen to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of our coat: wherein hee will haue vs to value a peaceable and quiet life among men, but eſpecially, our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and libertie to ſerue God, without hauing our deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions interrupted at ſo high a rate, as to part with any thing rather then to part with it, euen to forgoe our cloake alſo, when the coat is euicted before. Theſe are indeed hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall or ouer-reaching ſpeeches; yet doe they plainely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, how farre our righteouſneſſe ſhould ſtretch in this, and ſuch like caſes, and how peace which is the bond of charitie (as charitie is of perfection) ſhould bee prized, purſued, and redeemed of euery one of vs, euen with our greateſt loſſe, if wee cannot better cheape: <note n="h" place="margin">Hebr. 12. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Seeke or purſue peace with all men, and holineſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third inſtance toucheth men in their libertie; a thing no leſſe deare to them, then their liues and liuings: to bee compelled by impreſt from authority to go a mile, a league, or more at the officers pleaſure, as <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> was, by preſt, compelled to beare Chriſts croſſe after him. In which he will haue vs value our humilitie, loyaltie, and pliableneſſe to the higher powers (though forrainers, and aliens from the common-wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the <hi>Romanes</hi> were) at ſo high a rate, as to ſcotch at no hardſhip, to giue them, or their aſſignes, iuſt content. Wee are not onely to performe their commands (though grieuous in appearance) and that with all cheerefulneſſe and alacritie, but euen to ſtraine our ſelues
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16709:28"/> to double their demands, if need be, and it lye in our power: which holdeth in all other matters of like nature; to bee ſo farre from whining and repining at any ſeruice to our Prince and Countrie, at any rates and payments, that wee, of our owne accord, will rather put forth and heighten our ſelues, beyond that which is impoſed. How commendable were this, and what an ornament to the profeſſion of the Goſpell?</p>
            <p>To theſe three inſtances hee addeth a maruellous cloze, <note n="i" place="margin">Verſe 42.</note> 
               <hi>Giue to euery one that asketh, and from him that would bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row turne not away:</hi> not meaning, to euery inordinate asker, to maintaine idleneſſe and exceſſe, but to the truely needie and penurious, who, through vnauoideable neceſſitie, are brought into ſtreights: or, if through their owne fault, yet now ſeeming to repent, &amp; to giue hope of a new courſe: or at leaſt to ſuch, as being ſtrangers, &amp; vnknowne to vs, we, in the iudgement of charitie, take to be poore of the right ſtampe. To euery ſuch asker giue according to thine ableneſſe, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not prodigally, that liberalitie be not exhauſt, or eaten vp of liberalitie. In no caſe let the enmitie of any, or impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of requitall hinder thy good worke: but the rather doe all the good thou canſt to them (exſpecting thy reward from heauen) by giuing, if their needes call for that, or by lending, if they bee of a better ranke. Beware of vaine ſhifts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes, pleading thine owne wants (when thine owne heart giueth thee the lye, and God, who is aboue thy heart, ſeeth the contrary) or excepting againſt the perſons of the poore, meerely to put off a worke of mercy. If our Lord Chriſt had done ſo to thee, where hadſt thou beene, or ſhouldſt thou now bee? Remember euer that this is the Lords comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, &amp; that himſelfe commeth vnto thee, in their cloaths, to aske, and borrow.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, hee commeth to the vniuerſalitie of Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, and proueth it, by reſtoring to the natiue ſence, the ſumme of the ſecond table, <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour,</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Verſ. 43. to 48</note> purging it from the Phariſaicall droſſe: firſt teaching, that by the word <hi>Neighbour,</hi> not friends and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren onely are to be vnderſtood, but any other man, friend,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16709:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> enemie, or alien, who beare the image of God, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the ſame nature with vs. In a word, hee of whom wee may receiue, or to whom wee may doe good, any manner of way, is our neighbour, as Chriſt maketh plaine <note n="l" place="margin">Luke 10. 23. to 37.</note> in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable or example of the Iewes, falling among theeues, and cruelly handled: and relieued by a Samaritane, whom the Iewes had in abhomination.

Wherefore it followeth naturally, to charge them, that they doe not their righteouſneſſe, as the Scribes and Phariſies did theirs, to be ſeene of men.</p>
            <p>To make this yet more cleere, it is to bee obſerued, how not onely the particular inſtance of Almes, following imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, <hi>Verſe</hi> 2, 3, 4. but that of Prayer and Faſting are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vpon this generall propoſition, and accommodated to it, in one and the ſame manner and forme, without prefixing any other caueat, but this, which he maketh common to all three. But let vs heare what is propounded in the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

               <hi>Doe not your righteouſneſſe before men, to bee ſeene of them;</hi> as though hee ſhould ſay, I forbid you not ſimply to doe your righteouſneſſe before men: bring it vpon the ſtage, in the Name of God, though you haue ten thouſand lookers on: care not for that, the more the better: I haue exhorted you before, <note n="m" place="margin">Chap. 5. 16.</note> 
               <hi>that your light ſhould ſhine before men,</hi> and ſo let it doe, as much as you can: but beware you doe it not with a minde to bee ſeene and prayſed of men; that is the bane and break-necke of all goodneſſe: yea, it turneth the greateſt righteouſneſſe into the greateſt vnrighteouſneſſe: for what is greater vnrighteouſneſſe, then to put your ſelues into Gods place, by taking to your ſelues the glory of your righteouſneſſe, proper to God, the ſole authour and donour of it? We learne then from hence, aboue all things, to haue an eye, not onely that our actions be iuſt and holy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, (alas, there are not many, that goe ſo farre) but that our end and ayme bee anſwerable.

               </gap>me muſt needs be loſt; ſo in our beſt actions, and dealings, except we propound the right ends, we ſhall come ſhort of the prize of the high calling of God. A good end doth not alwayes ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the meanes of attayning to it (that is a Popiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, as in the Gun-powder-treaſon, and other ſuch like plots) but this is moſt certaine, that an ill end doth euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more corrupt and vitiate all indeauours, which are taken for it, though the workes in themſelues bee neuer ſo ſacred and holy; as appeareth plainly in theſe three noble inſtances, Almes, Prayer, Faſting, being done for vaine-glory, wordly pref<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rment, opinion of merit, or elſe without due reſpect to thoſe ends before mentioned. In his explanation by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, hee holdeth one vniforme order in euery one of them. Firſt, to dehort from <note n="q" place="margin">Verſe 2. 5, 16</note> hypocriſie and oſtentation, and that by reaſons of great moment. Secondly, by a moſt ſweet and forcible reaſon, <note n="r" place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe 3, 4, 6, 17, 18.</note> he exhorteth vnto humilitie and ſincerity. He dehorteth from hypocriſie and oſtention, and that by two reaſons; whereof the former is the moſt odious practice of the hypocriticall Scribes and Phariſies, to whom they muſt, in no caſe, be like: <note n="ſ" place="margin">Verſe 2. 5, 16.</note> 
               <hi>When thou doeſt giue Almes, faſt, and pray, bee not like the hypocrites.</hi> This faſhioning to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, the worſt of all people, can no wiſe ſtand with their preſent condition, who are, by Gods free election and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the beſt of all people; as being reſtored to the fauour of God, and renewed after his Image. But to beate his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the farther from them, hee ſetteth before their eyes, their leud, and, as it were, Player-like (ſo much the word <hi>hypocrite</hi> importeth) diſguizings. When they gaue Almes, vp went the ſound of the Trumpet; they made choice of the moſt celebrious places of the Citie, as the Synagogues, or ſtreets to act their Pageant vpon, to the greater vpbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the poore and magnifying of themſelues. Againe,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:16709:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> when they made their Prayers (I meane, not publicke but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary) no place would ſerue their turne, but the Synagogue, or corners of the ſtreets, where two or three wayes met, and no geſture, but ſtanding and perking vp, to be ſeene the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off. And when they faſted, inſteed of making their hearts ſad, they made a ſad countenance, inſteed of disfiguring their luſts, they disfigured their faces, for the very nonce; affecting rather the ſeeming, then the ſubſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſanctimony, the opinion rather then the thing. Is not this moſt baſe and loathſome dealing, enough to make one caſt his gorge? ought wee not to abhorre, and abominate any ſpice of it? Surely, as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> are ſaid to haue ſet their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and ſpuing ſlaues, before the eyes of their children, to cauſe them to abhorre drunkenneſſe: ſo doth our Lord and Maſter heere ſet theſe ambitious and diſſembling wretches, before the eyes of his Diſciples, and of all his faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to worke in them a hatred and loathing of ſuch doings, and to make them more in loue with humilitie and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon againſt hypocriſie and oſtentation, is the vnhappie ſucceſſe of it, which (to make the matter out of all queſtion) hee auoucheth with his vſuall aſſeueration, <hi>Amen,</hi> or verily, I ſay to you, <hi>they haue their reward.</hi> Praiſe they hauke after, and praiſe they haue; one corrupt man applauding another, (as one Mule or Aſſe knibbles ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:) and more then that, are they not to expect their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall dye with them. If they doe not out-liue it, as commonly hypocrites doe, whoſe vizards at the length God pulleth off from their faces in this preſent life, and inſteede thereof <note n="t" place="margin">Mal. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>casteth dung vpon them.</hi> But howſoeuer they enioy their bright and brittle reward all their dayes, being repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Saints vpon earth, yet ſhall that word of Chriſt ſtand for euer, <note n="u" place="margin">Luke 16. 15.</note> 
               <hi>That which is highly eſteemed among men, is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the ſight of GOD.</hi> And the more praiſe they find for the preſent, the more diſhonour ſhall they find at the laſt day, when fained holineſſe, charitie, and humilitie will clearely appeare to bee double deuilliſhneſſe and iniquitie.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16709:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> Then ſhall all time-ſeruers know perfectly by wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, how good a thing it had beene, not to haue <note n="x" place="margin">Iohn 5. 44.</note> 
               <hi>receiued honour one of another,</hi> but to haue ſought <hi>the honour, that commeth of GOD onely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſecond place, hee exhorteth them to humilitie, and ſinceritie in Almes, Prayer, and Faſting, aduiſing them rather to affect obſcuritie, by hiding their goodneſſe from the eyes of men, then ſame and celebritie, by ſetting themſelues and their good workes to ſale any manner of wayes. Hee would haue them learne the art of holy diſſimulation, ſo farre forth, that, if it were poſſible to hide it from their owne ſelues, they ſhould doe it, reſting vpon Gods approofe, teſtimonie, and reward alone. <hi>When thou giueſt Almes, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doth,</hi> ſignifying by this hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall prouerbe, that if the left hand had reaſon and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it ſhould be kept from the knowledg of that good which the right hand doth; then much more ſhould other folkes. Teaching vs, to be ſo farre from making that to bee our ayme, to pleaſe men, looking no further (as hypocrites doe not) that wee ſhould feare and flee nothing more, then to doe good vpon theſe conditions, to ſell away (as it were) our golden workes for ſuch a droſſie and durtie reward. But contrariwiſe to hold ſuch inwardneſſe and ſecrecie with God, as to make it our great and onely ambition, that hee alone (who alone is worthy) may bee pleaſed and glorified by all meanes. To this end ſerueth that which followeth, <hi>when thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet,</hi> or ſome ſuch place of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacie, ſequeſter thy ſelfe from all companie, ſet thy ſelfe in Gods preſence alone with alone: poure out thine heart in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret into his boſome, that dwelleth in ſecret. And know thou, that this bleſſed ſecrecie with God, will in ſpeciall manner further thy deuotion, and put by the occaſion of vaine glorie, ſo much hated of God, and preiudiciall to men. So when thou faſteſt priuately, howſoeuer thou weepe and bewaile thy ſinnes and miſerie, and the ſinne and miſerie of the time in ſecret, before thine heauenly father, yet openly before men ſet as good a face on it, and looke as cheerefully
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16709:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> as thou canſt, yea, rather then faile, vſe what Art thou canſt to that end, waſh thy face, anoint thine head (which was the manner of that countrie, to expreſſe ioy and cheerefulneſſe thereby) put thy ſelfe in ſuch a habit, as will beſt ſerue to couer thine extraordinarie humiliation. Let it ſuffice thee, in the act of faſting, to approue thy ſelfe vnto God, and to bee ſeene and knowne of him; as an honeſt Matrone is beautifull and trimmed enough, if ſhe be ſo in her husbands eyes, ſhee looketh after none other. Thou haſt much more reaſon to ſtand ſo affected towards thy God; ſo thyſelfe &amp; thine actions may be amiable in his eyes, to looke no further. His reaſon annexed hereunto, drawne from the fruit and benefit is very obſerueable; <note n="y" place="margin">Verſ. 4. 6. 18.</note> 
               <hi>And thy Father, which ſeeth thine Almes, Prayer, and Faſting in ſecret, will reward thee openly:</hi> where in the word <hi>reward,</hi> hee giueth none allowance to the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly traſh of Popiſh merit, but rather commendeth the rich treaſures of Gods mercie and goodneſſe, who freely accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs, accepteth our workes, done at his appointment, and through his gracious aſſiſtance; crowning vs, crowneth our workes. So <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 127. 3.</note> 
               <hi>children,</hi> and the fruits of the wombe, are called an heritage of the Lord, and his <hi>reward,</hi> and free gift: So elſewhere. The meaning is, that whereas hypocrites and vaine-glorious perſons, looking to men, and hauing their worldly aimes and ends, vtterly loſe their reward with God: the faithfull and truely religious, trading (as it were) with God alone, and hauing a ſecret ſtocke running with him of <hi>Almes, Prayer, Faſting,</hi> and other good workes, receiue in due time an open reward and bleſſing from their heauenly father, ſuitable to their foregoing endeauours. Neither are we to confine this open reward (as moſt doe) to the life to come only. But we are to know, &amp; be aſſured, that the Almes, Prayers, and Faſting of Gods children, are apparantly crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with moſt bleſſed ſucceſſe, beyond all expectation many times, euen in this very life. The mercifull man (as hath beene ſaid) findeth mercie in time of neede, according to his mercie ſhewed to others, and that with a rich increaſe many times. The prayers of the Saints come not weeping home,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16709:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> but fetch down bleſſings from heauen, to earth to their great ioyes increaſe. Their faſting alſo is oftentimes turned to feaſting; God giueth them <hi>beautie for aſhes, the oyle of ioy for mourning, the garment of gladneſſe for the ſpirit of heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> All which <hi>Cornelius</hi> the Centurion found moſt true by comfortable experience; for his Almes, Prayers, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, (not done in hypocriſie or of vaine-glorie, but in faith and ſinceritie) <note n="a" place="margin">Act, 10. 4.</note> 
               <hi>came in remembrance before God,</hi> and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an open and Illuſtrious reward from him. So this, or the like ſong, is often in <hi>Dauids</hi> mouth and penne, <hi>Thou haſt turned for me my mourning into dancing, thou haſt put off my ſack-cloath, and gird me with gladneſſe.</hi> The like experience had <hi>Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and many others, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe and ſecrecie with God, in the performance of theſe duties, carried away an euident and moſt ample reward, to the vnſpeakeable comfort of themſelues, and of the whole Church. And verily, there is no childe of God now liuing vpon the face of the earth, who hath not the like experience in ſome degree or other; receiuing euer in due time an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt anſwerable to his ſowing.</p>
            <p>All this, as alſo all the foregoing and following doctrine of Almes, Prayer, and Faſting, will yet better appeare, if we looke better into the nature of theſe three Chriſtian vertues. A true deſcription will direct vs to the right manner and end of performance of them. By <hi>Almes</hi> then we vnderſtand a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of reliefe to the poore and needy, according to our able<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, at Gods bidding, euen out of tender compaſſion, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they beare the image of God, and are our owne fleſh. Almes muſt be done at Gods bidding, who requireth and ſtreightly chargeth them to bee done, in the bookes of the Old and New Teſtament. So that the due performance of them is <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 112. 9</note> righteouſneſſe &amp; obedience, <hi>better then all ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice:</hi> and the contrarie I meane, the neglect of Almes, is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe and diſobedience, making men <note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 25. 41.</note> culpable of hell fire. What place is there then of ſeeking our owne praiſe, or ſeruing any ends of our owne? Almes alſo muſt proceed out of tender compaſſion: for the word heere tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16709:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Almes,</hi> ſignifieth mercie and pitie: whereby we learne not onely this leſſon, That not the thing giuen (how great ſoeuer) but the affection of the giuer maketh it Almes; but this leſſon alſo, That right Almes-giuers ſtand not vpon any by-reſpects: Pitie and compaſſion, with bowels yearning ouer their brethrens miſerie, is as a ſtrong law in their hearts, forcing them to giue, and doe good, when they can, and as much as they can, though they bee not praiſed for it, yea, though they ſhould bee diſgraced and puniſhed for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; as in times of perſecution, many haue beene, for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the neceſſitie of the Saints. This conſideration alſo, that they beare the image of God, and are our owne fleſh, without any other ſpur, is a ſufficient inducement therto. And as for prayer, what is it, but a moſt humble and familiar talking of the ſoule with God our heauenly father, by the direction and mediation of Chriſt Ieſus, his ſonne, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his holy ſpirit, about all matters, concerning his glorie and our owne good, that is, the good of our ſelues, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and corporall, and of the whole body and brotherhood of the Saints, with whom wee hold communion? And it comprehendeth <note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 1.</note> 
               <hi>ſupplication,</hi> or deprecation againſt euill; <hi>prayer,</hi> or petition for any good, which wee finde within our commiſſion to aske; <hi>interceſſion</hi> for others; and giuing of <hi>thankes</hi> for all things that befall, proſperous or aduerſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 8. 21.</note> 
               <hi>all worke together for good, to them that loue GOD.</hi> Which dutie of prayer being thus rightly performed, what place is there left for the heart to runne a rouing, or whoring rather, after worldly glory? And he that prayeth continually, how can he but haue his conuerſation in heauen? not ſeeking popular applauſe, but the things which are aboue, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God. And to adde that which he <note n="f" place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> addeth further in this paſſage of prayer, what place is there for vaine repetitions? ſuch as heatheniſh people vſe, who are without God in this world, and doe ſeruice to them, which by nature are no gods: who make none end of laying on tongue in prayer, becauſe they thinke to bee heard for their much ſpeaking, or babbling. But wee haue heard, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16709:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> it is moſt true, that prayer is a talking, not of the tongue, but of the heart, with God, of the ſpirit with a ſpirit, and that by the aſſiſtance of Gods holy ſpirit. This ſpeech of our ſpirits, with that incomprehenſible ſpirit, or Godhead, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſometimes it be expreſſed by words, in ſome ſort, as may be, and as our needes require (which words, for the moſt part, are, or ought to bee <note n="g" place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 2.</note> 
               <hi>few</hi>) yet conſiſteth it mainely in heauenly affections, and <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> 
               <hi>in grones and ſighes, that cannot be expreſſed.</hi> Away therefore with all lip-labour of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious perſons, of what ranke ſoeuer, conceiting that God is to bee. wooed and wonne with art, and multitude of words; as if prayer, <hi>exopere operato</hi> (as Poperie ſpeaketh) by the worke done, were a meritorious ſeruice, or ſome ſtrong ning charme, to bind God, &amp; make him condiſcend to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions. Surely, the praying in an vnknown tongue, the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ouer of many <hi>Pater-noſters &amp; Aue-Maries,</hi> &amp; ſuch like ſtuffe vpon the beades, praying by tale and number, rather then by weight, and infinite ſuch vſages, plainely demonſtrate that Poperie is full of this abomination, nothing at all ſhort of the heathen, if they goe not farre beyond them. So the manner of praying, vſed by many, (I would I might not ſay the moſt) of them that profeſſe themſelues to bee of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, admitteth none excuſe. When the Lords Prayer is rabled ouer without duevnderſtanding or reuerence, the Creede alſo, and tenne Commandements are recited and brought as prayers into the preſence of the diuine Maieſtie; with other ſet formes of prayer, ſound in themſelues like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and of very great vſe; but without iuſt attention and deuotion on their parts, that vſe them. And euen the forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſort many times conceiuing prayer (how worthily I will not ſay, but wordly enough, and too much) without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation, or due preparation, chopping into Gods ſacred preſence, and dealing with him in matters of the higheſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, concerning his glory and their owne eternall good, ſo inconſiderately and irreuerently, that it may too iuſtly bee ſaid vnto them, know you where you are, and in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence you ſtand? And euen ſo departing, call not to minde
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16709:34" rendition="simple:additions"/> before whom, and whereabout they haue beene. Doe not theſe, and many ſuch like courſes, too frequent in vſe, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeake, and proclaime (as it were with the ſound of a Trumpet) that there is very great danger, leſt our Prayers alſo turne into vaine and heatheniſh babling? This is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bee taken heed off, becauſe the neerer men approach vnto God, and the more grace they haue receiued at his hands, the more he looketh to haue his holy Name hallowed by them, and the more hotly ſhall his wrath and iealouſie breake forth, if it be not. We ſee therefore what need wee haue to <note n="i" place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 18.</note> 
               <hi>watch in Prayer,</hi> that wee bee not ouertaken, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtles doctrine, labouring by all meanes that this exhortation of our Sauiour Chriſt, among others, may ſinke into our hearts. Wherein, notwithſtanding, let it be remembred, that it is not ſimply repetition of the ſame words in Prayer, but vaine repetition, which is heere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: for when the ſame words are repeated, or with ſome little variation of ſpeech, to expreſſe the feruencie of our minds, and to further holy importunitie in Prayer, this no Scripture findeth fault withall: and the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in his Pſalmes, and other ſeruants of God often vſed it. The Sonne of God himſelfe, who forbiddeth vaine repetition, prayed in the Garden, the third time, <note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 26. 44.</note> 
               <hi>ſaying the ſame words:</hi> in this caſe we alſo may ſo pray otherwiſe, not, <note n="l" place="margin">Verſe 8.</note>

His abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Commandement, <hi>Pray continually and call vpon mee, in the day of trouble,</hi> and infinite ſuch like precepts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations to Prayer, are warrant enough for vs ſo to doe: and, ſo doing to ſhut the gate againſt all ſolicitude, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall carefulneſſe, according to the Apoſtles diuine counſell. <note n="m" place="margin">Phil. 4 6.</note>

            <p>This ſeruice or ſacrifice of Prayer being ſo worthy a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, ſo neceſſarie for all perſons and times, ſo many wayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed alſo, and the right practice of it ſo hardly attained vnto; our Sauiour Chriſt doth not thus leaue it, but hauing diſcouered the abuſes, as ambition, hypocriſie, vaine repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition alſo, and babling, <note n="o" place="margin">Verſe 9. to 16</note> hee now directeth vs to the right performance of it, <hi>After this manner therefore pray yee,</hi> or as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſetteth it downe, <hi>When yee pray, ſay:</hi> not binding vs ſtrictly to vſe theſe words alwayes, and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to vſe the matter, manner, and like affection: as appeareth plainly by the practice of Chriſt himſelf, and of his Apoſtles, who prayed ſundry times according to the matter, manner, &amp; affection, heere preſcribed, but not in theſe very words. But as for them, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſo wel inlarge their ſuits in other words, or for thoſe alſo, who can &amp; do it, yet remain ſtill vnſatisfied, as not hauing done it ſufficiently, (&amp; who can doe it ſufficiently?) the Lord hath left this moſt excellent helpe, to vſe the very words of this diuine Prayer, as the moſt worthy ſeruants of God euer haue done. And learne we heere by the way, what an abſolute neceſſitie lyeth vpon vs (which ought to bee our greateſt glory and comfort) to pray in theſe words, or in this manner: for it is the vndiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Commandement of our Lord Chriſt, <hi>After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pray.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, the excellencie of this Prayer maketh this bond the ſtronger. It muſt needs bee iudged moſt excellent, firſt, in regard of the authour of it: it is in name, and indeed <hi>the Lords Prayer:</hi> ſecondly, for the moſt pithy ſhortneſſe:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16709:35" rendition="simple:additions"/> thirdly, for the exquiſite order: fourthly, for the perfection, as contayning not onely all matters to be prayed for, but the abridgement of the Goſpell and of all Religion: fiftly, for the acceptation, when it is rightly vſed. If a man preferring a ſuite to a King, were not onely ſent by the Prince to his Father, but had his words put into his mouth, yea, had his Petition drawne with the Princes owne hand, and that by the Kings owne appointment, how great ſo euer the ſuite were, &amp; how poore and vnworthy ſo euer the ſubiect were, yet a man would thinke, hee needed not to doubt of good ſucceſſe in his ſuite. This is our caſe, praying thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and the caſe of all truly penitent: yea verily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely better then wee are able to lay it open by any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Commandement, <hi>Pray in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</hi> as for the Prayer it ſelfe, it is a principall ſubiect of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Catechiſing; ſo well commanded by authoritie, and practiſed by the Miniſtery in many places, that I purpoſe not to inſiſt vpon it: Onely I will ſet downe a very ſhort ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, which may giue ſome light to the ignorant, for the better vnderſtanding of it. The parts of the Lords Prayer (as it is notoriouſly knowne) are three; the preface, the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſixe in all, and the concluſion. The preface, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which art in Heauen,</hi> teacheth to whom wee are to pray; euen to <hi>GOD</hi> alone, beſides whom wee haue no Father in Heauen: and againe, how wee are to pray, to wit, in Faith, and in Charitie, and with the higheſt reuerence. In Faith, and that moſt aſſured, hauing to doe with our moſt louing and all-ſufficient Father. In Charitie, as calling God <hi>our Father</hi> in common with the whole bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood of Saints, with whom wee profeſſe our ſelues to hold communion. And with the higheſt reuerence that can bee, as comming into his preſence, whoſe throne is in the higheſt Heauens. Of the ſixe Petitions, the firſt three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the glory of God alone, with the meanes of glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, as the comming of his Kingdome, and doing of his will: the other three, our owne good (I meane the good of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16709:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> the whole brother-hood) corporall, and ſpirituall. In the firſt Petition, <hi>Hallowed bee thy name,</hi> wee deſire before and aboue all things, to haue Gods holineſſe, or diuine vertues, as his Wiſdome, Power, Mercie, and Iuſtice, knowne and acknowledged, and duely aſcribed to him, by word and deed, of our ſelues, and others, farre and neere. Or, in ſhort, that men vniuerſally may <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 1. 21.</note> 
               <hi>glorifie him as God,</hi> and be thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: or that <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 48. 10.</note> 
               <hi>according to his Name, ſo his prayſe might be, vnto the ends of the earth; According to his Name,</hi> that is, as he hath reueiled himſelfe in his Word and workes. In the ſecond Petition, <hi>thy Kingdome come,</hi> wee deſire the ſetting vp and aduancement of his Kingdome of grace vpon earth, and the manifeſtation of his Kingdome of glory in Heauen: but, eſpecially (no doubt) accommodating his Prayer to the time, hee teacheth them and vs to be ſuiters to God, that the promiſes, concerning the long and much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Kingdome of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> might bee accompliſhed ſtill more and more. As he had moſt graciouſly begunne al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie by his comming in the fleſh, victorious conflict with Satan, preaching of the Goſpell, miraculous operations, and gathering of Diſciples to himſelfe, as the ſeminary of his future Church; as alſo by the preaching and Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Zachary,</hi> his fore-runner. This worthily hath the next place, as the moſt ſpeciall meanes of hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Name. In the third Petition, <hi>thy will bee done in earth, as it is Heauen,</hi> we begge that the holy Will of God reuealed in his Word, or by the euent, may bee yeelded vnto of vs, and all his people, as vniuerſally, ioyouſly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, as it is of the bleſſed Angels and Saints departed, who are at his becke in euery thing, howſoeuer, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, we come farre ſhort of them. And this we craue, as a matter abſolutely neceſſarie, both becauſe we are one Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note n="r" place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> and Kingdome of Heauen (as our Lord Chriſt commonly calleth his Church heere beneath) with them, and becauſe our doing of the <hi>Will of GOD</hi> is the hallowing of his Name on our parts, which otherwiſe is <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ezek. 36. 20. Rom. 2. 24.</note> prophaned. In the fourth Petition, <hi>giue vs this day our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16709:36" rendition="simple:additions"/> daily bread,</hi> we intreate God the authour of theſe our ſoules and bodies to ſupport and comfort them, both in the ſtate of nature and grace, (ſo farre the ancient, and ſome new Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters alſo ſtretch it) by giuing food and foiſon, bread and the <hi>ſtaffe of bread,</hi> euen all neceſſaries of this life, and a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with his bleſſing vpon vs, in the vſe of them. To the ſtate of nature belongeth food, rayment, protection, gladneſſe of heart, &amp;c: to the ſtate of grace belong the Word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Miniſterie, the inward operation and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In the fift Petition, <hi>forgiue vs our debts, as wee forgiue our debters,</hi> we requeſt, that though we ſtill incurre his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, by our ſinnes (as it were ſo many debts) yet hee would not withdraw his mercie from vs, but ſettle our hearts in the aſſurance of pardon, and withall ſpare his Rods. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we profeſſe our ſelues to be perſwaded, becauſe euen we, that are euill by nature, haue learned, at his bidding, and by his example to ſhew mercie to our repenting brethren, who haue wronged vs, in what degree ſoeuer. In the ſixt and laſt Petition, <hi>leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill,</hi> we beſeech God, that though the Deuill deſire to <hi>win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now vs, as wheate,</hi> and we deſerue it, yet that he would not leaue vs in temptation, nor giue vs vp (as hee doth many to Satans, or (our own luſts, but aſſiſt vs euermore in our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall warfare, and that <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 16. 20.</note> 
               <hi>the God of peace would tread Satan vnder our feet ſhortly.</hi> Finally, in the concluſion, <hi>for thine is the kingdome, and the power, and the glory for euer, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> which is the third part, we learne, that God alone is to be called vpon, without fainting, wauering or doubting any way, and to be prayſed inceſſantly, becauſe the abſolute and independent ſouereigntie ouer all, and power to doe all, whatſoeuer he will, by his onely word or becke, and glorie for all (to which glory of his he hath ioyned our good, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall) belongeth incommunicably to him. How can he then, but, in due ſeaſon and manner, heare and helpe vs his poore ſubiects (ayming at his glory, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon him) according to the tenour of the Petitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foregoing?
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16709:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> In aſſurance whereof, wee ſet to our ſeale, as it were, by ſaying <hi>Amen, ſo be it,</hi> yea, <hi>ſo ſhall it moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be,</hi> and therefore, according to our bounden dutie, we reſt perſwaded of it, without taking any further thought about any of thoſe things, which at thine owne appointment wee haue asked. Thus much briefly of the Lords Prayer: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is added (as it were) a Poſt-ſcript, as an explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the reaſon of the fifth Petition: <note n="u" place="margin">Verſe 14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>For if yee forgiue men their treſpaſſes, your heauenly Father will alſo forgiue you: but if yee forgiue not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your Father forgiue your treſpaſſes.</hi> In which words, he maketh our forgiuing of others, though not the principall cauſe, mouing our heauenly Father to forgiue vs, (for <note n="x" place="margin">1. Iohn 4. 19.</note> 
               <hi>we loue him,</hi> and our Neighbour in him, <hi>becauſe he loued vs firſt</hi>) yet the certificatory cauſe (if I may ſo ſpeake) as a neceſſary fruit, and vnſeparable companion of the loue of God towards vs. So that where one of them is, either Gods forgiuing of vs, or our ſincere forgiuing one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both are: and where both are not, neither is. If my propenſitie and readineſſe to forgiue my Neighbour, who hath wronged mee ſeuen times, yea ſeuentie times ſeuen times, and to doe what good I can, to the wrong doer, and that of conſcience to God, bring not comfort to my ſoule, that my ſinnes are forgiuen mee, nothing can truly comfort. And if I can truly comfort my ſelfe before God, that I ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue, and doe good, then a figge for all, that the Deuill, or Man, or mine owne euill and diſtruſtfull heart can ſay to the contrarie: I will euer ſtop their mouthes with this; Euen I my ſelfe, that am euill, am taught of God, and, I thanke God, haue learned to forgiue men their treſpaſſes, vpon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to doe them what good I can; much more then my good God, and heauenly Father will, vpon mine vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Repentance, forgiue me all my treſpaſſes, and doe mee all good. And not without caſe is this point ſo much inſiſted vpon, becauſe he knoweth our propenſitie to reuenge, and to beare a grudge and loathneſſe to be reconciled one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as alſo, becauſe <note n="y" place="margin">Pſal. 32. 1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes</hi> is our maine freehold, and inheritance, wherein conſiſteth our euerlaſting <hi>bleſſedneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:16709:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>Thus much concerning his directions for prayer: let vs now at the length proceede to the deſcription of faſting, which wee may in ſome ſort define, to bee an <note n="z" place="margin">Leu. 23. 32.</note> afflicting of our ſoules before God by a holy abſtinence from foode, and all other comforts of this life (ſo farre as may well bee) for the ſpace of foure and twentie houres, <note n="*" place="margin">Eſter 4. 16.</note> or more, according to the occaſion, to teſtifie and further our humiliation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and zeale in prayer. This afflicting of the ſoule before God, can no more ſtand with vaine glorie and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, then fire and water, light and darkneſſe can agree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And theſe true ends of faſting, humiliation in repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and zeale in Prayer, are as directly oppoſite to all Phariſaiecall and Papiſtical opinion of merit, <hi>ex opere opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> by the worke done, as any thing can bee; for they conſiſt meerely not in any vaine plea of the merit of our worke, but in a moſt humble confeſſion of our guilt and miſerie. Beſides the true manner of faſting from food, and other comforts of this life, for foure and twentie houres, or more, confuteth plainely, not ciuill abſtinence from ſome kinds of meat, at certaine times, for politicke reſpects; but the Romiſh abuſes in their manner of faſting, ſtanding in abſtinence from fleſh, and their Supper, in lieu whereof they puniſh their carkaſſes many of them, with ſuch drinkings (wherein there is plentie of bread, beere, wine, cakes, and diuers other iunkets) as many poore Chriſtians of the reformed religion, if they looked to their belly onely, would giue them high thankes, to exchange with them for their Suppers.</p>
            <p>Hitherto wee haue heard of the properties of Chriſtian righteouſneſſe, that it is ſpirituall, vniuerſall, and ſincere: the parts ſhould now follow; but becauſe there are three things eſpecially, which hinder the atainement and practice of righteouſneſſe, with the parts of it, to wit, worldlineſſe, raſh iudging, and indiſcretion, he firſt ſetteth himſelfe moſt earneſtly againſt them; eſpecially againſt worldlineſſe. For as they were wont to ſay of <hi>Ottoman</hi> the great Turke, his horſe, that where he ſet his foot, nothing would grow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe cruell Turkes made all deſolate and waſt, where
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16709:38"/> they preuailed: ſo may it bee ſaid, that where this horſe of that great <hi>Ottoman,</hi> the diuell (I meane worldlineſſe) ſetteth his foot, no goodneſſe can take place. Hee dealeth againſt this, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſ.</hi> 19. to the end of the Chapter: and finding world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded folkes ſicke of a two-fold maladie, to wit, inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate carefulneſſe about vnneceſſarie riches, and carking and caring about neceſſarie ſupplies; he dehorteth earneſtly from the firſt, to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> 25. from the ſecond, in all the reſt of this ſixt Chapter. Concerning the point of vnneceſſarie riches, hee firſt forbiddeth <note n="a" place="margin">Verſe. 19</note> the laying vp of treaſures vpon earth: ſecondly, commandeth <note n="b" place="margin">Verſe. 20.</note> vs to lay vp for our ſelues treaſures in heauen. Thirdly, <note n="c" place="margin">Verſe. 21.</note> hee annexeth a weightie reaſon, why we ſhould doe not the one, but the other: fourthly, <note n="d" place="margin">Verſe. 22, 23 24.</note> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth certaine obiections, which either were, or hee ſaw would bee made againſt that hee taught. Heere wee are firſt to vnderſtand, that beating men off, from laying vp treaſures vpon earth, he putteth not by honeſt labour and induſtry, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery where called for in the holy Scriptures; nor the vſe and fruition of riches, yea, of great eſtates, permitted by the word of God, and <note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 25. 5. 6.</note> practiſed by his moſt holy ſeruants, in all ages; no, nor yet ſimply <note n="f" place="margin">Prou. 13. 22.</note> to gather, and treaſure vp riches for poſteritie, much commended in holy writ: but exceſſiue<note place="margin">2.

Surely, as the Cherubin, by Gods
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:16709:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> appointment, with a flaming ſword, kept <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> out of Paradiſe: ſo through Gods iuſt vengeance, this, not Angell, but Deuill of couetouſneſſe, keepeth the Vaſſals of this preſent world, as it were with a flaming ſword, from the fruition of their rich eſtates, which they haue gotten with great trauaile. The wiſdome then, that we are to learne from hence, is not to trouble our ſelues, or ſpend our precious time about ſuperfluous riches, but to ſpend our time and trauaile about things neceſſarie and requiſite for our perſons and for the calling, wherein God hath ſet vs; ayming alwayes at the true ends of getting, gathering, and laying vp in ſtore, which (in ſhort) are, that wee may haue to liue and to giue, I meane to liue decently and commendably according to our places: prouiding alſo, ſo much as in vs is, that our wiues, children, and others belonging to vs (whom the Apoſtle calleth <note n="g" place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 8.</note> 
               <hi>our owne</hi>) may doe the like after vs, prouing rather helpfull then chargeable to any, if it be the will of God: and to bee able to giue alſo to all pious and charitable vſes, for maintenance of Church and Common-wealth, and reliefe of our needie brethren, eſpecially thoſe of the houſhold of faith. Which prouiſion of meanes both to liue and giue, reacheth to all, euen to the pooreſt ſwaines that liue vpon the face of the earth, <note n="h" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteale no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing that is good, that hee may haue to GIVE to him that needeth.</hi> And this is indeed not to lay vp treaſures vpon earth for our ſelues, when knowing our ſelues to be but Stewards, entruſted with our Maſters goods, wee ſo labour in our callings, with all our might to get them, that being gotten, we make it our chiefe ſtudie and care about worldly things, thus to imploy them altogether according to his mind. The words, <hi>vpon earth, moth, canker, and theeues,</hi> containe reaſons againſt this ſinne, and thoſe of great force. For concerning the ſubiect, or place, <hi>the earth,</hi> is it not monſtrous, that men ſhould once dreame to finde any piece of their happineſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, by laying vp treaſures vpon earth? Since <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> with all their poſteritie, then in their loynes, were
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16709:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> caſt out of Paradiſe, to inhabit this earth, as a place of exile and baniſhment, yea of perpetuall penance: ſince alſo the curſe of God lyeth vpon the whole earth for the ſinne of man, and ſhall lye vpon it, vntill the time of the reſtoring of all things. What blindneſſe is it then to imagine, that by any skill wee ſhall bee able to fetch bleſſedneſſe out of this earth, which the Lord hath curſed, though a man could gaine tho whole world to himſelfe. Againe, for the adioyned corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; caſualty by moths, canker, &amp; theeues; is it not more then monſtrous, that men ſhould goe about to make that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their glory and felicitie, which ſhould ſerue to humble them, and to raiſe vp their mindes to the expectation of the new heauens and earth, wherein ſhall be righteouſneſſe, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and ſtabilitie? What can a man looke vpon in this world that carrieth not a brand of his ſinne, and of the curſe adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? yea, that carrieth not a ſword, or whip in the hand (as it were) to puniſh him for ſinning againſt his Creator, wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely for his becke to ſtrike, and it ſtriketh?

Why doe you trouble your ſelues ſo much to heape and hoord vs vp, as if any part of your felicitie lay in vs? why doe you fall together by the eares, and bee readie to plucke out one anothers throate for vs?

            <p>After the dehortation, exhortation, and this Reaſon, whereof we haue now heard, two Obiections follow, <note n="y" place="margin">Verſe 22, 23.</note> the firſt, in theſe words, <hi>The light of the body is the eye: if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

If therefore the light, that is in thee, be darkneſſe, how great is that darkneſſe?</hi> In both which Verſes is an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to a ſecret Obiection, If there bee ſo great a treaſure in Heauen, why doe ſo few find and affect it, according to the worth, but all men almoſt ſeeke their treaſure heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath? The anſwere is, becauſe the cleere eye of the Soule is wanting to them, without which there can bee no right choice of their treaſure, or placing of their affections. The ſimilitude is plaine, and runneth thus; As in the bodie, if the light thereof, which is the eye, bee ſimple or cleere, the whole body, or conuerſation, is lightſome and orderly; whereas contrariwiſe, if the eye be troubled, all is full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as being done in the darke: ſo if the light, that is in vs, <hi>viz.</hi> our Reaſon and vnderſtanding be cleere, that is, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated by the Word and Spirit of God, to diſcerne and iudge aright, all goeth well, and according to the minde of God: but if corrupt, and void of iudgement, (as it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, by <hi>Adams</hi> fall) <hi>how great is that darkneſſe?</hi> their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, ſinne, and ſpirituall miſerie is moſt wofull, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerble. Men are then ſo ſtupid, that they are not able ſo much, as to take knowledge of their lamentable condition, no though it be neuer ſo plainly layde open vnto them; much leſſe can they take knowledge of the remedie: but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as diſtempered perſon, flee from it and reſiſt it.

               <note n="a" place="margin">Lu. 11. 34, 35, 36.</note> The ſumme of Chriſts Parable, in that place, commeth to thus much, That if the whole bodie or man befull of light, that is, of knowledge and ſanctimonie, then the whole life or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation ſhall bee full of light, that is, ſhall ſhine in good

            <p>The ſecond obiection followeth in theſe words, <note n="e" place="margin">Verſe 24.</note> 
               <hi>No man can ſerue two maſters: for either hee will hate the one, and loue the other; or elſe hee will hold to the one and deſpiſe the other; ye cannot ſerue GOD and Mammon:</hi> where he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth them who were ready to obiect, and ſay, (as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly men doe, at the leaſt, in their hearts) wee will doe both; wee will apply our ſelues to Gods ſeruice, and to the gathering and hoording vp of riches alſo; wee will lay vp for our ſelues treaſures on earth, and in heauen too. It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (ſaith Chriſt) to ſerue both, to ſet your hearts vpon theſe two treaſures at once. This hee cleareth by a ſimilitude drawne from a ciuill bodie or ſocietie, (as the former was from a naturall body.) As (according to the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe) no man can ſerue, or wholy addict himſelfe to two maſters, eſpecially requiring contrarie, or if but diuers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, at one and the ſame time, but either he will hate the one and loue the other, or elſe hee will hold to the one and deſpiſe the other: No more can any man poſſibly ſerue God and riches, requiring offices, not onely diuers but directly contrarie. The ſeruice of God (as wee know) calleth for truth and plaineneſſe in all our dealings: the ſeruice of riches for cunning courſes, colloguing, and out-ſtripping one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the oddes of wit. The ſeruice of God mainely vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16709:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> mercie, liberalitie, and laying vp of treaſures in heauen: the ſeruice of riches will haue ſparing, pinching, niggardli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and laying vp treaſures vpon earth. God, and Chriſt, our heauenly Maſter, abſolutely command all his followers to cleaue to him and his Goſpell, with the loſſe of all, yea, euen of their very liues: on the other ſide, riches bind their vaſſals to cleaue cloſe to them, whatſoeuer become of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of their owne ſoules. The holy taske, which God layeth vpon his ſeruants, is prayer, the exerciſe of the Word and Sacraments, due obſeruation of the Sabbath, holding of an holy correſpondencie and communion with the Saints; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their affections vpon heauen and heauenly things, and ſuch like: on the contrarie part, riches will giue their poore ſlaues no time to minde or attend vpon ſuch matters: all ſuch workes are blacke-workes, yea loathſome to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of <hi>Mammon.</hi> Finally, God delighteth to finde in his ſeruants an earneſt lingring and longing after his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, not onely of grace, but of glorie, that they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire (according to his will) to bee looſed, and to bee at home with him: but <hi>Mammon</hi> the great God and maſter of this world, cannot abide that; he lulleth and ſingeth his ſeruants aſleepe by giuing them (with the rich glutton) their conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in preſent. So that the wiſe man breaketh into this exclamation, not without cauſe, <hi>O death, how bitter is the remembrance of thee to a man that liueth at reſt in his poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe, and many other reſpects, the ſeruice of God and riches cannot ſtand together. A man may ſerue God, and vſe riches, as alſo all honeſt purueyance for them: but ſerue them, that is, to ſet his heart vpon them, making them, if not the onely, yet the principall obiect of his deſire, hope, confidence, loue, ioy, feare, ſadneſſe, anger, &amp;c. This thraldome cannot ſtand with the ſeruice of God, iuſtly ſtiled <hi>perfect freedome.</hi> Hence may wee learne moſt worthy and neceſſarie leſſons; firſt, that except God haue our whole ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, hee will haue none of it. The old ſaying is, <hi>Loue and Lordſhip will indure no Partnerſhip:</hi> hee profeſſeth himſelfe to be our husband, and that a iealous one; hee cannot beare
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16709:43"/> not onely groſſe idolatrie (as it were ſpirituall Spouſe-breach) but mentall idolatrie, by ouer great loue of the creatures, and affiance in them. He in like manner is our abſolute Lord to whom alone belongeth all honour and ſeruice, becauſe he alone hath made vs for himſelfe, and ranſomed vs moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable captiues out of the hands of all our enemies, bodily and ghoſtly. Further, wee learne, that then God hath our whole ſeruice, when forſaking all other, wee loue and cleaue vnto him alone. For to this end is mention made of <note n="f" place="margin">Verſe 24.</note> louing and cleauing, or holding to one Maſter. Now thus to loue and cleaue to our heauenly Lord and Maſter, is, as we know the tenour of the whole Law, <note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 22. 36.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt loue the Lord thy GOD with all thine heart, ſoule, ſtrength,</hi>

               <hi>thou ſhalt cleaue to him, &amp;c.</hi> It is alſo the condition propounded in the Goſpel to euery Diſciple of Chriſt Ieſus, <note n="i" place="margin">Luke 14. 26.</note> 
               <hi>If any man come to me, and hate not</hi> (in compariſon of mee) <hi>father and mother, wife and children, yea, and his owne life, hee cannot bee my Diſciple.</hi> It was the exemplaric <note n="k" place="margin">Ioh. 8. 29.</note> practice of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt ſo to loue his heauenly father, cleaue vnto him, and pleaſe him in all things, not doing his owne will. And this, and none other is the end of our being in the ſtate of nature and grace, and of all Gods benefits in hand, and in hope. The ſumme of all, and the maine ſcope or ayme of this parable, is, that for men to ſet their hearts vpon riches, is plainely to renounce God: for his peremptorie concluſion is, <hi>Ye cannot ſerue GOD and Mammon,</hi> or abundance. It lyeth euery man in hand therefore very ſtrictly and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to examine himſelfe, whoſe ſeruant he is, leſt, being ſuddenly ſurprized, while he is in the ſeruice of riches, he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh vnrecouerably, with the louers of this preſent world. And whereas, for the moſt part, men are onely afraid of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, which they dread more then ſickneſſe, infamie, yea, then diſhoneſtie and death it ſelfe: our wiſdome is to feare riches (as <note n="l" place="margin">Prou. 30. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Agur</hi> did) as much, if not much more, knowing the danger of them, which few eſcape. Whereof Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe giueth warning, <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 19. 23.</note> 
               <hi>How hardly doe rich men enter into the kingdome of heauen?</hi> Becauſe it is a moſt hard thing to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16709:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> haue riches, and not to truſt in them, not to reioyce in them more then in the liuing God, howſoeuer the heart of man, (deceitfull aboue all things) will not bee brought to ſee and confeſſe it.</p>
            <p>In the next place followeth the ſecond branch of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or worldlineſſe, conſiſting in ſolicitude, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great carefulneſſe about neceſſarie ſupplies, what to eate, drinke, or put on: which tractate holdeth to the end of this ſixt Chapter. Wherein (as in the former branch) hee both dehorteth from the inordinate ſeeking of the very neceſſaries of this life: and alſo exhorteth <note n="n" place="margin">Verſe 33.</note> to the ſeeking (with might and maine) of the things of a better life.

Secondly, it is vrged by ſundry reaſons of great importance, which wee will take, as they lye in order. He propoundeth it with very great earneſtneſſe, in manner of a concluſion, or inference vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his former doctrine, concerning couetouſneſſe, ſtriking heere, at the very roote of that ſinne, putting vpon it alſo (as his manner is) the weight of his authoritie, <note n="o" place="margin">Verſe 25.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore I ſay to you, take no thought for your life, what you ſhall eate, or what you ſhall drinke, nor yet for your bodie, what you ſhall put on.</hi> In which words alſo is implyed an anſwer to a common obiection, I looke not for great things, my care is onely for foode and raiment.

If we could (as dutie bindeth vs) be brought hereunto, we ſhould then liue in this World, as in an ample and magnificent Temple, furniſhed with moſt beautifull Images, or Laymens Bookes of Gods owne making, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh and comfort vs vpon euery occaſion, and ſhould haue no need of Popiſh Images, to that end, directly againſt the expreſſe minde of God, reuealed in his Word. And let me adde thus much more, for the increaſe and confirmation of our comfort heerein; By this compariſon drawne from the vnregarded foules of the Aire, from Sparrowes and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens (as wee may ſeec, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 6. 24.) wee are taught, that no ſence of our owne vileneſſe, or want of meanes, ought to plucke vs from reſting vpon Gods Prouidence, but rather ſend vs to it.

And ſhall not we, made after Gods owne Image, redeemed by the bloud of his onely begotten Sonne, ſealed by his Spirit vnto the day of Redemption, to whom it is his good pleaſure to giue the Kingdome, doe it much more? The third Reaſon, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo with a vehement Interroation, doth demonſtrate the vanitie and vnprofitableneſſe of taking thought about outward ſupplyes, <note n="m" place="margin">Verſe 27.</note> 
               <hi>Which of you by taking thought, can adde one Cubit to his ſtature?</hi> What manner of reaſoning this is, Chriſt himſelfe ſheweth elſewhere, <note n="n" place="margin">Luke 12. 26.</note> 
               <hi>If then yee be not able to doe that which is least, why take yee thought for the reſt?</hi> So that hee maketh it a reaſoning from the leſſe to the greater: to be of tall, or lowe ſtature, conferreth little, or nothing, to a comfortable life; yet are wee not able by any ſolicitude or carefulneſſe to mend our ſelues therein any whit. All that wee can doe, is, to vſe the meanes, which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16709:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> God hath appointed to that end, by taking ſuſtenance, and preſeruing our health ſo much as in vs is, and to leaue that increaſe of our ſtature and of our childrens, to God alone: ſo in like manner are we, for competencie and ſuffizance in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, to vſe the beſt induſtrie and prouiſion that wee can, and then in faith and holy dependance to expect the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe from God, <note n="o" place="margin">Prou. 10. 22. Deut. 8. 17, 18. Pſal. 127. 1.</note> 
               <hi>whoſe bleſſing onely maketh rich,</hi> and giueth content. The ſhort is, that as our ſtature, ſo our ſtate of life commeth meerely from the hand and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Almightie God. That notable compariſon, which <hi>Irenaeus</hi> taketh vp to illuſtrate the doctrine concerning the communion of Saints, may well bee taken vp in this caſe: As one lumpe and one loafe cannot bee made of drye wheate, without moyſture, ſo neither can wee, being many, be made one in Chriſt, without the water which is from heauen. In like manner, how wiſe and working heads ſoeuer men haue, and what meanes and indeauours ſoeuer they vſe, yet the lumpe or leafe of thrift cannot be kneaded or raiſed vp, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out liquor from heauen, that is, without Gods bleſſing. Where that is wanting, great husbands with all their great trauell and cares, doe but as bowlers, who crye rub, rub, and bend their body which way they would haue their bowle to goe, but all in vaine.</p>
            <p>Hitherto our Lord Chriſt, <note n="p" place="margin">Verſe. 25. 26, 27,</note> hauing earneſtly taxed men for torturing their minds about neceſſarie foode, doth now the like about rayment, <note n="q" place="margin">Verſe 28. 29, 30.</note>

               <hi>Maſter, to whom ſhall wee goe? thou hast the words of eternall life.</hi> This haue I thought good to point vnto by the way: let vs now proceede.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16709:47" rendition="simple:additions"/> this weightie point, he repeateth his exhortation and addeth two reaſons more againſt diſtruſtfull and anxious looking after foode and rayment. His repetition is in another forme, very ſignificant: for thoſe carers and carkers about outward things are broght in vttering their own diſtruſtful thoughts, ſauouring of ſome ſpice of Atheiſme. For as if they had no God to prouide for them, or as if all the promiſes of God were moone-ſhine in the water, they ſay, <note n="c" place="margin">Verſe 31.</note> 
               <hi>What ſhall we eat? what ſhall we drinke? or wherewith ſhall we bee cloathed?</hi> as doubting how it may or can be, all meanes failing, either by loſſes, deadneſſe of trading, increaſe of charge, olde age, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, perſecution, and ſuch like diſaſters. So did the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, when for their probation and tryall, they were ſomewhat hard put to, the next was, <hi>Where ſhall wee haue water to drinke? who ſhall giue vs fleſh to eate?</hi>

Wherefore as Chriſt rouzed vp his Diſciples in another caſe, <note n="e" place="margin">Mat 26. 41</note> 
               <hi>Watch and pray leſt yee enter into tentation: the ſpirit is willing, the fleſh is weake:</hi> ſo are wee euery one of vs to rouze vp our ſelues in this very caſe.

And though he brake not out into ſuch loude and paſſionate ſpeeches; yet whether his heart were not full of diſtraction, fretting, and murmuring, but rather (as it ought to bee) by reſting vpon God, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himſelfe vnder his correcting hand, hee gaue glorie to God, making him his onely ſanctuarie and repoſe. In ſumme,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16709:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> our Sauiour Chriſt, in theſe often repetitions, commendeth this vnto vs, as an high and neceſſarie point of wiſdome and dutie, not to ſuffer our mindes to bee troubled or royled (as it were) with the ſence of preſent want or expectation of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture euents, but <note n="f" place="margin">Iohn 11. 9. and 9, 4.</note>

How doe wee profeſſe the hope of an heauenly inheritance, if vpon Gods promiſe and perpetuall experence of his mercifulneſſe and truth, in prouiding for his owne, we bee no more ſecure of our earthly ſuſtenance, then they.

               <hi>are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out GOD in this world?</hi> The ſecond reaſon is drawne from the knowledge or regard of God; <hi>your heauenly Father knoweth that you haue need of all theſe things;</hi> meaning, that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16709:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> hee knoweth perfectly, and that with more then a Fatherly reſpect and regard of vs. For ſtiling him our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (becauſe his glory chiefly ſhineth there) he would haue vs to vnderſtand, and remember, that hee is moſt willing and able to ſuccour vs, in all extremities, (as Parents, in high place, can and doe their children.) So that wee are heere taught to ſtay our ſelues in the greateſt temptations of this nature, with this meditation, which can neuer faile, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs, That God, our heauenly Father, is priuie to all our needs, and that he hath the greateſt power, and propenſitie alſo to relieue and helpe vs, and will doe it alſo in due time, when it may doe vs moſt good. If this comfort were ſeated in our breaſts (as it ought to be) wee might ſafely ſing <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away,</hi> and take vp that of the Prophets, <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 3. 5. &amp; 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>I will both lay me downe in peace, and ſleepe</hi> (whatſoeuer ſtreights I be in for the preſent) <hi>becauſe thou, Lord, onely ſuſteineſt mee, and makeſt mee dwell in ſafetie.</hi> Whereas, contrariwiſe, the ſtaggering heerein is the cauſe of all diſcomfort, and euen of deſpaire, and death it ſelfe: for <note n="n" place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 10.</note> 
               <hi>worldly ſorrow,</hi> arriſing from thence, <hi>cauſeth death.</hi> Thus wee ſee what patheticall Inhibitions and Reaſons this diuine Teacher hath vſed, to beate vs from the inordinate ſeeking of the very neceſſaries of this preſent life.</p>
            <p>In the three and thirtieth Verſe he interlaceth an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ſeeke the things of a better life; <hi>But firſt ſeeke the Kingdome of GOD, and his righteouſneſſe,</hi> (annexing, for our incouragement, an ample promiſe thereto,) <hi>and all theſe things ſhall be miniſtred vnto you.</hi> Wherein, becauſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are cured by contraries, he laboureth to draw men from vndue, yea, vngodly carefulneſſe about earthly matters, by ſtirring them vp to moſt due, religious, and neceſſarie care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe about heauenly. As Phyſicians, to ſtay the inward bleeding, by reaſon of ſome rupture in the bodie, vpon a veine: ſo Chriſt heere, to ſtay our ſpirituall bleeding, and languiſhing, by reaſon of that fearefull rupture of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or worldly carefulneſſe, openeth a veine, as it were, to turne the bloud of our ſoules quite another way. He taught
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16709:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> vs before <note n="o" place="margin">Verſe. 10.</note> to pray for <hi>the comming of the Kingdome of GOD,</hi> that is, for the ſetting vp, and aduancement of his Kingdome of Grace vpon Earth, and manifeſtation of his Kingdome of glorie in Heauen; but eſpecially for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement and inlargement of the much expected King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> then beginning to appeare, whereby the Name of God was chiefly to be hallowed, or glorified; which glory of God is (as we know) the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the beginning and the end of our whole life, and euery acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Wherefore this Kingdome of God, being the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary meanes of it, is primarily before, and aboue all other things, not onely to be ſued, but to bee ſought for; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſuing, without ſeeking, is idle, as ſeeking without ſuing to God by Prayer, is preſumptuous, and ſpeedeth thereafter. Againe, as this Kingdome of God is to be ſued, and ſought for, ſo his righteouſneſſe, <note n="*" place="margin">1. Iohn 3. 23. &amp; 5. 3.</note> or doing his will by Faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and Charitie expreſſed by obedience to all his Commandements. So that his preſent exhortation is thus much in effect, Inſteed of hauing the World, and the things of the World in chace (as moſt haue) carking and caring about this preſent life onely, to no purpoſe, God knoweth, but to their extreame annoyance, and vtter vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if God be not mercifull vnto them; to make the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God and his righteouſneſſe their gaine and ſport, imploying all the powers and faculties of their ſoules and bodies in the purſuite of it, ſtudying and labouring by all meanes, that the Goſpell and Church of Chriſt (commonly in the New Teſtament called the Kingdome of God, and of Heauen) may ſpread, and be glorified, and that obedience of Faith at all hands, eſpecially of their owne ſelues, may bee yeelded thereto, more and more. Now if men knew the gift of God, and what it is to haue him reigne in them, and ouer them, by his Sonne, Spirit, Word, and Ordinances, there would bee no great need to vſe many Reaſons to perſwade hereunto. The more is it to bee lamented, that inſteed of this ſeeking the Kingdome of God, and his Righteouſneſſe in the firſt place, the Cart is ſet before the Horſe, and the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16709:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> World, with the luſts of it, muſt firſt be ſerued, <hi>Quaerenda pecunia primum, virtus post nummos:</hi> Money and things of like nature muſt haue the primacie; Religion and vertue find, for the moſt part, the poore Chriſtians entertainment, <note n="p" place="margin">Iam. 2. 3.</note> 
               <hi>ſtand thou there, or ſit heere vnder my footſtoole.</hi> And againe, whereas Chriſt putteth the Kingdome and Righteouſneſſe of God together, and it holdeth in this eſpecially, <hi>What GOD hath ioyned together, let no man put aſunder,</hi> a moſt impious Diuorce of theſe is commonly attempted, (at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, I ſay, not made, that cannot be) to ſeeke, haue, and hold his Kingdome, without his Righteouſneſſe. As when <hi>Boaz</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Ruth. 4. 7.</note> made offer of <hi>Elimelechs</hi> Land, the next Kinſman anſwered, <hi>I will redeeme it:</hi> but when the condition was added, <hi>What day thou takeſt the Land, thou muſt take</hi> Ruth <hi>the Moabiteſſe to wife, to rayſe vp the name of the dead, vpon his inheritance,</hi> that made him ſhrinke in the wetting: <hi>I cannot redeeme it</hi> (ſaith he) leſt I marre mine owne Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: ſo let an offer of Chriſt, our Sauiour, of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and of euerlaſting life, through Faith in his name, be made; many are moſt readie to ſtrike vp a match: but tell them, what day they meddle with Chriſt, they muſt meddle with his Righteouſneſſe, <note n="r" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 17.</note> 
               <hi>they muſt turne new creatures;</hi> howſoeuer they dare not profeſſedly diſclaime, yet inwardly they ſhrug at it, and are readie to plucke off their ſhooe, and giue it to any that will take it: <note n="ſ" place="margin">Ruth. 4. 7.</note> they will not marre their Inheritance, by parting with their paultry profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>But let vs now come to ſee wherein this ſeeking chiefly conſiſteth. Firſt, vndoubtedly in ſearching for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, who Chriſt Ieſus is, and what hee hath done for the ſaluation of man, what that <hi>great myſtery of godlineſſe is,</hi> 
               <note n="t" place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 16.</note> 
               <hi>GOD manifeſted in the fleſh, iuſtified in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſeene of Angels, preached vnto the Gentiles, beleeued on in the World, receiued vp in glory.</hi> This moſt admirable myſterie is, before and aboue all things to bee ſought, and looked into, and all things to bee accounted no better then droſſe and draffe, in compariſon heereof. The meanes which
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16709:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> God hath ſanctified for this purpoſe are (as wee haue beene taught) to bee aſſiduous and conſtant in <hi>ſearching the holy Scriptures,</hi> and ſitting at the feet of the faithfull Preachers, to heare their doctrine.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it conſiſteth in the effectuall ſeeking after the participation, and enioying of this bleſſed Kingdome; ſo that we know our ſelues truly infranchiſed therein, and bee able out of infallible ſence, or (at the leaſt) apprehenſion of Faith, to ſay with the Apoſtle. <note n="u" place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Our conuerſation,</hi> or Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>geſhip, <hi>is in Heauen.</hi> This is done when the holy Word or Goſpell <note n="x" place="margin">Heb. 4. 2, 3.</note> 
               <hi>is mixed with Faith in them, that heare it: for we, which haue beleeued, doe enter into reſt.</hi> This Faith, with the daily increaſe of it, is to bee ſought after with might and mayne, as in a matter of life and death.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this ſeeking conſiſteth in our vttermoſt indeauour to ſpread &amp; inlarge this Kingdom, euery one according to his gifts and calling. Worldly men runne themſelues out of breath, to ioyne houſe to houſe, and land to land, that, if it were poſſible, they might dwell alone vpon earth, And the Scribes and Phariſies compaſſed Land and Sea, to make a Proſelyte: ought not then the Burgeſſes of this heauenly Kingdome be ſharp-ſet vpon the inlargement and aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it? Accounting it their ioy and crowne, yea, the very life of their life, to winne many to Chriſt Ieſus, their Lord and Souereigne, to ſee the Goſpell, which is the Sword or Scepter of his Kingdome, to <note n="y" place="margin">2. Theſ. 3. 1.</note> 
               <hi>haue free paſſage, and to be glorified.</hi> Surely this is, and ought to bee the mayne ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and indeauour of all true ſeekers; of the Clergie, as of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the myſteries of God; of priuate men and women, as of helpers to the Faith. Queſtionleſſe, if the Prophet and people of God were ſo affected to the earthly Ieruſalem (the onely Mart, &amp; Staple of true Religion in thoſe dayes) that they ſolemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profeſſe and proteſt, <note n="z" place="margin">Pſal. 137. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>If I forget thee, O Hieruſalem, let my right hand forget her cunning: if I doe not remember thee, let my tongue cleaue to the roofe of my mouth, if I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre not Ieruſalem aboue my chiefe ioy:</hi> wee ſhould infinitely
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16709:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſtand more tenderly affected to the heauenly <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to the Citie or Kingdome of the liuing God, to ſeeke the good of it, by the propagation of the moſt glorious Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Chriſt Ieſus, alwayes, by all meanes, grieuing at the contrary.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, our ſeeking of it conſiſteth in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king how to grace, beautifie, and adorne (ſo much as in vs is) the Goſpell and Church of Chriſt, by the ſhining bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a right Chriſtian conuerſation, <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> according to that which wee heard before. This is that righteouſneſſe of the Kingdome heere mentioned, which ſerueth as a notable lure to draw many to the loue and obedience of the Goſpell. So that firſt to ſeeke the Kingdome of God, and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is to vſe all diligence, (whatſoeuer become of vs, and of all other things) to know, participate, inlarge, and adorne his bleſſed Goſpell, and the refined eſtate of his Church and People, by the comming of his Sonne, the promiſed <hi>Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> into the world. And withall, ſo demeaning our ſelues, as his dutifull ſubiects vpon earth, to reſt ſweetly in hope and expectation of that moſt glorious life and immortalitie, which is reſerued in heauen for vs. The promiſe annexed, is, <hi>And all theſe things ſhall bee added vnto you:</hi> as when a grand Mannour is made ouer to any, all the royalties paſſe with it: ſo this inheritance, incorruptible, vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, being once aſſured to vs by our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, the pettie matters of this life cannot but attend vpon it. <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 12. 32.</note> 
               <hi>Feare not little flocke</hi> (any want of foode or ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>for it is your Fathers good pleaſure to giue you the Kingdome.</hi> So that howſoeuer this be a paradoxe, or ſtrange opinion to the world, yet among them that are perfect (as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh) it muſt be receiued and acknowledged as the wiſdome of God, and an infallible truth, That the onely ſure way to get ſufficiencie of all needfull ſuccours for this tranſitorie life, with the cheerefull vſe of them (which few haue) and a clauſe of warrantize againſt all danger, is, by<note place="margin">c <hi>Mat. 22. 29.</hi>
               </note> ſeeking the Kingdome of God, and his righteouſneſſe. If there bee any demurre about this moſt cleare point, it is (as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16709:51"/> was ſaid to the <hi>Sadduces</hi>) becauſe men know not <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor the power of GOD.</hi> For wee know that the holy Scriptures affoord infinite promiſes of this kinde, and in like manner, infinite examples of Gods prouident and powerfull purueyance for his owne people, in all ages; as for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes, while they were ſoiourning in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Egypt;</hi> the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe; <hi>Dauid</hi> 
               <note n="d" place="margin">Pſalme 23.</note> in all his diſtreſſes; for <hi>Eliah,</hi> by Ranens; the widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> by drawing out the meale in the barrell, and oyle in the cruſe; the poore widow of one of the ſonnes of the Prophets, <note n="e" place="margin">2. King. 4. 1, 2.</note> by a ſtrange multiplication of oyle; for <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ierem. 22. 15.</note> who did eate and drinke, and it was well with him, doing iudgement and iuſtice; the followers of Chriſt in the wilderneſſe, fed and ſatisfied two ſeuerall times; his Diſciples <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 22. 35, 36</note> going forth at his bidding, without purſe, ſerip, or ſhooes; to let paſſe other examples which are innumerable. There is no faithfull man or woman, ſeeking the Kingdome and righteouſneſſe of God in truth, and perſeuering therein, that hath not experience in ſome degree of the performance of this moſt gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, at one time or other; howſoeuer God exerciſe their faith and patience for a ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, to taxe our great propenſitie to this ſinne of diſtruſtfulneſſe, and to beat vs yet more throughly from it, he addeth a third repetition of his fore-going prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inferring it vpon his former promiſe to this effect, Since God hath paſſed his word, <hi>that all theſe things ſhall be added to the ſeekers of his Kingdome and righteouſneſſe.</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Verſe 34.</note> 
               <hi>Take therefore no thought for tomorrow,</hi> that is, not ſo much as for the time neareſt at hand, but truſt God with it. Doe the worke of euery day on the day, vſe withall the beſt proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and forecaſt that you can, eate, drinke, and be cloathed, according as God hath bleſſed you, doing alſo what good you can, to all, and there an end. Torture or vexe your ſelues no further about future euents or ſupplies: if thou beleeueſt that God is thy God, and heauenly father, that hee will not leaue thee nor forſake thee, according to his free and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full promiſe, (which aboue all things is to be beleeued,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16709:51" rendition="simple:additions"/> that hee which looked to thee, and fed thee to day, will doe the like tomorrow: and though hee ſeeme not to doe it, yea though hee kill thee, yet with patient <hi>Iob,</hi> reſolue to truſt in him, according to thy bounden dutie. Many haue befooled themſelues for truſting in God too little, but neuer any for truſting in him too much, and for not leaning to their owne wiſdome. The rule for the due obſeruation of the Sabbath, may, and ought, in ſome ſort, to take place herein, that which cannot bee done before nor after, and yet is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to be done, muſt bee performed euen vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; otherwiſe to bee put off: ſo that care or prouiſion for tomorrow, or the time to come, bee it long or ſhort, which cannot indure leiſure, is preſently to bee made, as in ſummer againſt winter, in youth againſt olde age, in ſingle eſtate, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt marriage, which is full of charge; in breeding time (which many bruite creatures neglect not) againſt bringing forth, &amp;c. But where no ſuch vrgent neceſſitie appeareth, there to leaue euery thing to the owne time and place, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tomorrow alone with his owne care and worke, as our Sauiour Chriſt heere moſt elegantly ſpeaketh. To doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, is to double our burthen, when the ſingle alone lyeth very hard and heauie vpon our ſhoulders. <hi>The morrow ſhall take thought for the things of it ſelfe; ſufficient vnto the day is the euill thereof:</hi> which affordeth this leſſon vndeniably vnto vs, That ſorrow and labour is euery dayes portion to euery man, according to Gods iudiciarie ſentence in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>In ſorrow thou ſhalt eate of it</hi> (meaning, of the fruits of the earth) <hi>all the dayes of thy life.</hi> This holdeth much more in the faithfull, who beſides the common cup, whereof all muſt needes drinke, haue a ſpeciall one mingled to them for their chaſtiſment, tryall of their faith, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in well-doing. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">Act. 14. 22.</note> 
               <hi>confirming the ſoules of the Diſciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith,</hi> aſſured, <hi>that wee muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdome of GOD.</hi> What follie and madneſſe is it then for vs, by taking forbidden thought about the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of this life, to adde yet more to the heape or pile of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16709:52"/> thoſe vnauoideable euils, which by Gods vndiſpenſable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, follow both nature and grace; As if a man in a hot burning feuer, or vnder the ſtrong paines of the ſtrangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, winde-colique, or gout, ſhould wilfully increaſe his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe by euill dyet and ſurfeiting.

As flyes ſwarme about any raw or tender part of the bodie, and though they bee ſcared away, yet returne againe, or others in their roome: ſo doe theſe troubles and miſeries continually ſwarme about our wounded and tender ſoules, ſo that though there bee a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and chaſing away of them in part, through Gods good grace, yet will they, or a new ſupply returne to vexe one way or other, continually and inceſſantly; the end of one affliction prouing (for the moſt part) the beginning of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Wherefore wee haue euer need of patience, it muſt be of daily and hourely vſe, as the very garments which wee weare, for couering and defence: without it, wee may not ſet our foot ouer the threſhold, nor venture our ſelues into companie or buſineſſe. Grant Lord, that this <note n="n" place="margin">Iam. 1. 4.</note> 
               <hi>patience may haue her perfect worke, that wee may bee perfect and intire, wanting nothing.</hi> But aboue all the faith of the Saints is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie both to beare vp their patience by the helpe of hope, expecting the heauenly reward, apprehended by faith: and alſo to put life into all this moſt holy, comfortable, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible doctrine of our Lord and bleſſed Sauior, againſt world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carefulneſſe, and concerning Gods diuine prouidence and prouiſion for vs in all our needs; which wee are commanded many times ouer to reſt vpon, without doubting and waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16709:53"/> conſcience, to reforme and gaine one another, and not to croſſe, gore, and ſhame one another, or any other ſiniſter end. The thing heere forbidden, is an euill Diſeaſe or Itch in our corrupt nature, whereby, either out of malice or in a kind of brauery, men are ſharp-ſighted and curious, euer peering into other folkes frailties, yea, making faults many times where none are, and, in the meane ſeaſon, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther careleſſe of their owne faults, though neuer ſo foule and groſſe: they are more then Eagle-eyed abroad, and as blind as Beetles, or Moules at home. To preuent this euill ſo much oppoſed by Chriſt, our wiſdome is, firſt, to beware of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſpeaking againſt any bodie in paſſion, or when we doe but ſuſpect our ſelues to bee paſſionate, by reaſon of ſome vnkind paſſages betweene vs and any other: for Anger, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie: Diſdaine, and ſuch like affections, may bee reſembled to falſe Glaſſes, which make euery thing appeare otherwiſe then it is. It will be ſafeſt, in that caſe to bend our ſelues to the contrary, either to ſay nothing at all, or make the beſt of euery thing. Secondly, in indifferent matters, which may be done, or left vndone, without ſinne, to carrie our ſelues as indifferent perſons, not iudging one another in meate, drinke, apparell, company, recreations, or any thing of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but leauing euery man to ſtand, or fall to his owne Maſter, it is ſufficient for vs, vpon good grounds, to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded in our owne minds of the lawfulneſſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniencie of that, which we our ſelues doe. It was extreame vncharitableneſſe in the Scribes and Phariſies, to bee euer cenſuring of Chriſt and his Diſciples, about healing on the Sabbath day, eating with Sinners, and with vnwaſht hands, plucking the eares of Corne, &amp;c.

A dramme of Charitie, Wiſedome, and Humilitie, would haue holpen all that. Thirdly, to preuent raſh iudging, wee muſt acquaint our ſelues more and more with Chriſtian equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which teacheth to ſet the beſt conſtruction vpon euery
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16709:53" rendition="simple:additions"/> thing, which hath ſome appearance of euill: if it will beare any good conſtruction, Charitie (which biddeth vs loue our Neighbours as our ſelues) bindeth vs to make the beſt of it: and if, among many conſtructions, one onely bee good, to take that. So deale Parents, excuſing, before ſtrangers, all the weakneſſes and faults of their children, ſo farre as there is any place for an excuſe: ſo one deare friend, with another; and thus ought it to bee among all Chriſtians. Fourthly, where no excuſe can be found, but a fault is a fault, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, yet when it ſeemeth to proceed of frailtie, Charitie (which beleeueth all, and hopeth that all ſhall bee well) being euer long-skirted, is not ſlacke to ſpread her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ouer it. It inſulteth not, it clamoureth not, it divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not, but laboureth to hide it, ſo much as is poſſible. Feeling members of the myſticall body of Ieſus Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to couer ſuch things, euen as people deſire to hide (ſo much as in them is) the vncomely ſores and blaines in their naturall bodie. Fiftly, they goe yet further; for if any be <hi>ouertaken in a fault,</hi> they endeauour, with all their might, <hi>to reſtore ſuch a one, with the ſpirit of meekneſſe,</hi> dealing ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly with them (as Surgeons with ſuch armes and legges of their Patients, as are broken, or out of ioynt) <note n="y" place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note>

               <p>This ſhall ſuffice for the charge: let vs take in the reaſons, and all the reſt, more briefly. The firſt is from the danger to haue the wrong done to others in their good name, retaliated or returned backe vpon our ſelues; for ſo hee ſaith, <hi>that yee bee not iudged.</hi> God in his iuſt iudgement will raiſe vp others to pay vs home with our owne money, to ſerue vs as wee haue ſerued others; to cenſure the cenſurers, to backbite the backbiters, to whiſper of whiſperers, to ſcoffe at ſcoffers, to raile vpon railers, in a word, to miſ-iudge miſ-iudgers.

And this vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of our Lord Chriſt, in reprouing, (who vſed not to be ſtirred, but for very great cauſe) ſheweth not onely how deteſtable this ſhameleſſe ſelfe-loue, pride, and hypocriſie, is in the eyes of God, and ought to be in our eyes, but alſowhat propenſitie is in euery one of vs, to hood-winke our ſelues, and paſſe by our owne fouler corruptions: and in the meane ſeaſon, as if wee had no worke at home, to caſt our eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad vpon other folkes, and to take their actions and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (nothing ſo much out of ſquare as our owne) to doe; as if Lazars, all ouer-ſpread with botches and blaines, ſhould haue their fingers itching to turne Phyſicians, for the healing of other mens puſhes and pimples.</p>

This then is the rule of our Lord Ieſus, euer to bee remembred of all that deſire to doe good in their places, and not much harme to themſelues and others, That whoſoeuer goeth about to mend others, muſt firſt mend himſelfe, and he that taketh vpon him to redreſſe his neighbours leſſe faults,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16709:55" rendition="simple:additions"/> muſt goe through-ſtitch in the redreſſing of his owne grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faults. Is it probable that he, who is faſt ſet in the quag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire of groſſe wickedneſſe and hypocriſie, ſhould worke his brother out of the ſlough or ordinarie frailties and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? It is a rule in oratorie, that to moue others, a man muſt firſt bee moued himſelfe; hee muſt feele the part which hee acteth: this holdeth in preaching, reprouing, inſtruction, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, or whatſoeuer other dutie of that kinde, which neceſſarily call for an affectionate reformation of our owne liues, with an inteſtine hatred and loathing of whatſoeuer ſinnes wee formerly liued in. And as for authoritie, wee know it is vtterly loſt, and inſteed thereof contempt and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion commeth in place, when it may bee ſaid, <hi>Phyſician, heale thy ſelfe.</hi> Naturally men are led rather by the eye, then by the eare, (as hath beene ſaid) ſo that when they heare good words and ſee euill deeds, they will incline rather to what they ſee, then what they heare. In ſumme, Chriſt teacheth vs thus much, that it is a moſt fearefull thing for Miniſters, Magiſtrates, Parents, Maſters, or ſeeming Zelots of any kind to haue the place, and to take vpon them the office of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, if their practice hold not correſpondencie in all points, with their place and profeſſion.

But it is to bee vnderſtood, that Chriſt heere ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of regnant ſinnes, when there is alſo little or no care vſed for the repreſſing or reforming of them, but onely a face of holineſſe ſet vpon it, borne vp by moſt vnconſcionable cenſuring of othets.

               <p>But our Lord Chriſt readeth vs a Lecture heere worthy and neceſſarie to be learned of all that looke to be ſaued; not to liue by examples, but by Rules, euen the infallible Rules of the holy Scriptures, let the examples bee what they will, excepting that of Chriſt Ieſus.

               <p>All they that are carefull to walke according to theſe Rules, may know themſelues aſſuredly to be in it: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, they that complaine of them to bee ouer ſtrict, or are readie to ſay, It were well indeed, if we could doe them, but where is the man, who can? and ſo will needs be deſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed withall for the whole, or, at the leaſt, for ſome part; let ſuch ſet their hearts at reſt, they haue no part nor fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in this buſineſſe.

Take your parts among Hypocrites, your aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, according to your demerits, in the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone. For howſouer you made a profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of godlineſſe, and imployed my gifts and graces to ſerue your owne ends, that you might ſeeme ſome-bodie in my Church: yet in your hearts and practice alſo (open, or ſecret) you were <hi>workers of iniquitie;</hi> turning your ſelues into the courſes of this ſinfull World, balking and beating downe the ſtreight wayes of the Lord, and cauſing all others to do the like, ſo much as in you was. But letting them alone, and leauing them to their Lord and Iudge; bee it ſpoken to all that are indeed Religious, and, with full purpoſe of heart, cleaue vnto the Lord, how ſtreight and narrow ſoeuer the gate and way be, as the Apoſtle ſpake to his Scholer <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>

               <p>Wherefore to conclude this paſſage, as all the reſt; I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly intreate all good people, to take Chriſts yoke vpon them, and to hold on conſtantly in the narrow way, what ſloughes, and rubs ſoeuer they meete withall; Heauen will pay for all, and in the meane ſeaſon, God, that cannot lie, hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to leaue nor forſake them. Giue no way either to the inchantments of falſe Prophets, or to any vaine opinion or ſhew of zeale, without the ſubſtance and truth of it (beware of ouer-weaning) or to any conceit of your owne, or other mens worth, by reaſon of ordinary or extraordinary great gifts. Whatſoeuer is not godlineſſe, as Faith, Hope, Charitie, Zeale, Humilitie, Meekneſſe, Temperance, Patience, Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, Heauenly mindedneſſe, vſe it ſo far forth, as God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth it for vſe, and labour euer to make the beſt vſe of the beſt graces, and Ordinances of God, but reſt not therein.
